I used to be one of those "don't be a phone chump, use a desktop" chumps, mainly because I thought that having a mobile-friendly site meant that it had to look generic and "corporate".

I realized that this didn't need to be the case after coming across some other indie web developers' fun sites. So, I wanted to challenge myself in making my personal site fun AND accessible.

## Bechno Kid's Hideout should have the following:

- Mobile-responsive layouts throughout the site
- Toggles for light and dark mode
- US English set as every page's language
- Text contrast that passes the WebAIM color contrast checker
- Scalable text sizes (using EM instead of PX)
- Text that is primarily aligned with right, center, and left. *Never* justify.
- Alt text for non-decorative images
- Semantic HTML
- Pages that can be navigated via a keyboard
	- This includes a link to skip to the main content
- Javascript usage will be kept to a minimum
  - Whatever page that uses JS will be noted
- Animated GIFs that can be paused via buttons (this requires JS)
  - Even with JS disabled, warnings will be implemented for flashing and blinking GIFs
- **Absolutely no autoplay**

This site will frequently be tested in multiple sizes and resolutions. I might still miss some things, but I will do my best to fix them if pointed out, so don't be afraid to let me know via [email](mailto:bechnokid@yahoo.com)!
