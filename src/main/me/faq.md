summary: I've gotten a lot of questions over the years. Many of them are asked pretty often, which is why I created this page! If you have another question that you don't see on this page, feel free to email me at **bechnokid@yahoo.com**.

## Me

- **Where did the name "Bechno Kid" come from?**
  - My sister and her friend group came up with several nicknames for themselves. As a lonely middle-schooler, I always wanted a cool name. I originally went with "Techno Kid" but somewhere along the way, I started using "Bechno Kid".
- **What does "Bechno" mean?**
  - It doesn't mean anything! It's a word I made up, but I think it sounds pretty neat!
- **What's that thing on your head!**
  - It's my mask! It's based off of the cute masks you can give to your Chao in the Sonic Adventure games!

## Art

- **What kind of tools/software do you use for your art?**
  - [Clip Studio Paint v.4](https://www.clipstudio.net/en/) with an [XP-Pen Fun Deco S tablet](https://www.xp-pen.com/product/deco-fun-xs-s-l.html) for drawing, and [Photoscape](http://www.photoscape.org/ps/main/index.php) for any final edits! I also use [Color Quantizer](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Others/Color-quantizer.shtml) for resizing and compressing my art without losing too much of the quality.
- **Will you open commissions again?**
  - I don't think I will since I just don't have the time anymore! If by some miracle I decide to open commissions again, I will make sure to make an announcement post at least a few days in advance before opening them!
- **Is there a way to support your work without commissioning you?**
  - You can always [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/bechnokid), but you're never obligated to! {% emote 'happy' %}
- **Are you open for art trades/requests?**
  - I am not, but I am open to suggestions that are related to my current interests! There's no guarantee that I'll get to them, but they're open!
- **Can I use your art for icons/headers/banners?**
  - Definitely! As long as it's fanart (excluding gift art and commissions) and you give proper credit, such as providing a link back to the original work.
- **Can I draw fanart of your characters?**
  - Of course! {% emote 'love' %} All I ask is that you don't draw something that you wouldn't show to your grandparents.
- **Will you ever draw _____ again?**
  - It's not likely if it's something I haven't drawn in a while since my interests tend to fluctuate a lot. {% emote 'embarrassed' %}

## Fandom

- **Have you watched/played/heard of _____?**
  - Maybe or maybe not! I"d rather not be asked these kinds of questions!
- **What do you think of _____?**
  - I probably won't know enough to give you an opinion unless it's related to a current or previous interest, sorry!
- **Are you a proshipper or an anti?**
  - Neither. I'm too old to get involved in tiresome discourse! You can see my thoughts on this over on my [fan](/personal/fan#thoughts-on-taboo-topics) page!
