## What am I up to?

- Doing some much-needed work on our hydrangea garden. Our family and I may not have green thumbs, but we want to keep our hydrangeas happy and healthy!
- Working through my ever-growing backlog of YouTube videos to watch, including finishing a web documentary about [Andrew Dobson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZG3GyIqitE).
  - Andrew was a pretty big inspiration of mine as an artist with an art style that combined aspects from Western and Japanese (mostly anime) artwork. Funny enough, he was an inspiration in a sense where I tried to make sure I wouldn't end up like him. It's honestly a shame that he mostly wanted to blame others for his shortcomings rather than actually reflecting on his own behavior. Oh well! Hindsight is always 20/20.
- Dealing with allergies. Even after taking loratadine, the amount of pollen in the area has been slightly hindering my work! I can only imagine how much more miserable I'd be without my medication!
- Slowly going through my art to post on this site. I hope I have enough space!
- Art-wise, I think I'm going through a bit of a block. It's the kind where I want to draw _all_ the things, but I just don't have the time or energy to do it! Every time I come home, I just want to play Monster Hunter lol.
- Pondering about joining more webrings. I've been wanting to join more, but part of me gets pretty embarrassed when the admins haven't accepted my application, so I just look like some desparate loser seeing the "This user hasn't joined the webring, yet!" xDD

## Playing
- [Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/)
  - Participating in the Blossomdance Festival. It's so fun and pink!
  - Started maining the Gunlance after being forced to use it in an Arena Quest. Can't believe I've been sleeping on such a fun weapon for so long!

## Watching
- Kill la Kill (Blu-Ray)
  - This will be my third time watching the series! Watching it with my wife has been so much fun!

## Listening to
- なとり / natori - [Overdose](https://song.link/y/H08YWE4CIFQ)
