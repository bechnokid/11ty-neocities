### General

- I think the reason why I might have felt "off" the past couple of weeks might have been because of seasonal depression! I keep forgetting it's an actual thing that people can suffer from lol. I'm doing a lot better now, just in time for Halloween!
- Still in the same situation as I have been at work for a while now, made slightly worse no thanks to the shutdown affecting everything for everyone everywhere! It's a good thing that I've saved enough money for rainy days like this!

### Playing

- [Digimon Story Time Stranger](https://www.bandainamcoent.com/games/digimon-story-time-stranger)
  - This is quite honestly the best Digimon game I've ever played!! I made so much art for the game that I hope to share someday. For now, I'm just going to continue gushing over my new ship. {% emote 'love' %}
  - I might write a review on this someday if I have enough spoons to write...but the spoons usually end up getting used for life, drawing, and games. {% emote 'embarrassed' %}
- [Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/)
  - The Dreamspell Festival has started recently! I'm not a huge fan of the music in the hub, the new song from the Diva, nor the new barrel bombs that have a random projectile in the Barrel Bowling mini-game, but it's still been a lot of fun!
  - The new armor sets look great, and I'm so, **so** glad that armors are no longer gender-locked! I can finally look like a spooky pumpkin ghost!!
  - Arch-tempered Nu Udra kicked my butt pretty good! I got the male's layered armor and the Palico layered weapon before deciding I didn't want to hunt the fire octopus anymore lol.
