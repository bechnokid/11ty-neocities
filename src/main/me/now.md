### General

- It's almost 2026! I'm still working from home surprisingly enough! It's been great since the daily commute put a lot of strain on my knees, and they've been given time to heal!
- Speaking of work, my company gave me an Amazon gift card, so I went and got myself something that I had been thinking of getting for a long time, a tub of Gamer Supps! I was lucky enough to try some free samples a couple of years ago, and I was happy to see that the flavor I wanted was available on Amazon. {% emote 'happy' %}

### Playing

- [Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/)
  - Nothing says "Merry Christmas" like getting your ass kicked by Gogmazios and Arch-Tempered Jin Dahaad while dressed as Santa Claus! This is the final update for Wilds, so I can't wait to see what's in store for the expansion. {% emote 'excited' %}
- [Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/) (modded)
  - Sam recently started adding mods to TotK, and she was more than happy to share her hard work with me by letting me play on a new file, and it's been so fun!!
