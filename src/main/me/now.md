### General

- Five days until my birthday! I don't think I'll be doing anything special except celebrate it with my loved ones. I usually like to merge it with Valentine's Day to make it easier for us to schedule. It helps that I also love Valentine's Day!
- I might be working an office job again! I will definitely miss working from home, but at least working at this job will mean that I'll be doing more development work as well as actually leaving my house more often lmao.
- The ice storm we had in the East Coast has definitely made things a bit more inconvenient. I can't tell you how much I want to play in the snow, only to see that it's solid ice. {% emote 'sad' %}
- I found a drama VTuber that I thought I lost forever: [Sephera de Noma](https://www.youtube.com/@sapheravt)!
  - I admittedly do enjoy watching internet drama, but I'm pretty picky on which YouTubers I want to follow since so many can be extremely biased. However, she, [Mujin](https://www.youtube.com/@MujinOfficial), and [Rima Evenstar](https://www.youtube.com/@rimaevenstar) have been my favorites to watch so far.
  - That being said, I don't watch a lot of VTubers or streamers in general. I honestly can't see myself listening to someone talk for hours. The only streamer I'm subscribed to is my IRL friend, [Corgi](https://www.youtube.com/@thenerdycorgi)! Their videos are short and easier to digest, and I enjoy watching their gameplay. :3

### Playing

- [Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/) (modded)
  - I completed the popular [Depths of the Kingdom](https://gamebanana.com/mods/578624)! My short review is the dialogue was a bit too edgy for my taste, and some of the bone-like textures on the Stal monsters looked very "crunchy". I can't quite explain it lol. Otherwise, it was so much fun and made the Depths so beautiful (and even scarier, which I didn't know was possible)!
- [Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/)
  - I actually spent most of January playing the modded version of TOTK instead of MH, oops. I picked it up again recently after getting inspired to craft more elemental versions of my main weapon, and I wanted to see just how rusty I got. I managed to complete a couple of Gogmazios hunts without fainting once! The only times I failed those quests would be when the other team died. I was afraid that it was mostly my fault for not supporting my team enough. However, Monster Hunter is a game where you kinda have to pick up your own slack, so I didn't feel too bad!
