## What am I up to?

- Getting back into crocheting!
- Stressing about my job for the first time in years. I won't get too much into detail, but the past month or so hasn't been entirely fun...

## Playing
- [Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/)
  - Just waiting for Title Update 2!
  - Trying to collect all of the size crowns for every monster! It's always fun, but some monsters are really hard to find crowns for some reason??
- [Cookie Run Kingdom](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devsisters.ck&hl=en-US&pli=1)
  - It's fun and keeps me busy for a while, but I'm not a huge fan of the story, and I haven't found myself liking any of the other characters besides Burning Spice Cookie lol
  - I might write a review on this someday!

## Watching
- Videos related to MediEvil. I recently found out about the news of the [film adaptation being cancelled](https://medievil.wiki/w/MediEvil_(PlayStation_Productions)), and I'm just grieving at the moment...
