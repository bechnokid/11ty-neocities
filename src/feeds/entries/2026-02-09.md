  - New affiliates section in [/links](/links)

Added a new section for affiliates in my [links]({{ meta.url }}/links) section!

If you'd like to be an affiliate, just shoot me an email at **bechnokid@yahoo.com**!

The only requirements I have is that your website isn't just an "About Me" page. Not that those are bad or anything, but I love sites with a ton of content in it, whether it's art, blogging, writing, anything!

That's it for now! Have a great day, everyone!
