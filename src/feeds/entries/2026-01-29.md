Hello everyone! I hope you are all doing well. We all experienced a pretty nasty cold front over here in the East Coast, which makes me all the more grateful that I've been working from home. I hope you are all staying warm this winter!

Here are the latest updates!

- New art in the [Anime](/art/anime) and [Other](/art/other) sections!
- Lots of new goodies, including:
  - Two more [Pocket Bishounen](/goodies/pocket-bishies) quizzes to take.
  - Lots of graphics I [adopted](/goodies/adopts)
  - Some graphics I collected for [pixel clubs](/goodies/pixel-clubs)
- Added more [links](/links)! One day, I'll be brave and ask some of these new sites to be  affiliates! One day!
- Various bug fixes and minor updates

That's it for now! I hope you all of a wonderful day!
