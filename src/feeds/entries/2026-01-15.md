Happy New Year everyone! Today is also the day that the long-awaited version 3.0 of Animal Crossing New Horizons is released! I hope everyone has fun with it.

There are some pretty big updates today:

- New artwork in the [Games](/art/game) section! This is technically a crossover piece, but I don't have enough to make a new section yet lol
- New page: [Fangirling](/me/fan), a page that's just me rambling about my experiences and preferences as a fan of media!
- [Status Cafe themes](/resources/status-cafe/themes):
  - Did a huge rehaul by improving how a theme is previewed and installing a button that will copy the code to your clipboard, making it easy to just paste it into the text box for the **About** section,
  - Added a new theme! Those from Neocities in 2022-2023 might recognize it lol. I'm being a little shameless with this one hehe.
- Added some more links! The more links I move from my bookmarks to this page, the more cool websites I keep finding. This is what I love about the indie web hehe.

That's it for now. I hope everyone has a great day!
