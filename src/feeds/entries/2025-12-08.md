Hi everyone! It's another cold day in December. We actually had one snow day here! We sadly haven't had snow since then, but I'm holding out hop that it will snow on Christmas!

This update seems pretty small, but that's because most of the updates were on the back end! However, an update is still an update!

Here are the latest changes:

- Added new clique: [Crystallizing](https://crystallizing.neocities.org). Yes, I chose that gem specifically because of that one animanga, teehee.
- Updated [RSS](/feeds) and made into page that holds other feeds
- Cosmetic updates including:
  - Unifying colors, especially colors for links
  - Updated [404 page](/not_found) image to better match my current look
- Backend updates and fixes including:
  - Minifying and bundling CSS for optimization (hopefully the CSS is still readable to use as reference!)
  - Updated CSS and JS code for Freezeframe script thanks to [FriendShapedPlant](https://friendshaped.garden)!

That's it for now! See you next time!
