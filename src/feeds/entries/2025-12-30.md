Hi everyone! I hope everyone has had a good time during the winter holidays. This will be the last update for the year. :D

There are so many changes in this update that I'm not sure if I can put them all in this single entry without it being too overwhelming. XD

So, I'll list the most important ones (to me)!

- New artwork in the [Digimon](/art/digimon) section
- Made a [to-do](/to-do) list for the site
- Added two [links](/links)
- Meadow's guestbook service is currently down, so I linked to my [atabook](https://bechnokid.atabook.org/) instead. Hopefully it gets fixed soon!
- Optimization updates (hopefully):
  - Consolidated most of my JS files into one
  - Fixed up JS for webrings page
