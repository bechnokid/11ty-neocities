Hello, everyone! I hope things are going ok for all of you! It's still pretty cold, but I hear that it'll get warmer next week! Just in time for my birthday!

Here's what's new in this update!

- I moved the light/dark toggle button to be positioned below the navigation sidebar! I figured this might be easier to access since the sidebar is always fixed in one position.
- New art in the [anime](/art/anime) section!
- Added a new [code snippet](/resources/code-snippets). I think Tumblr veterans might recognize this one. {% emote 'wink' %}
- Updated [now](/now) and [pixel club](/goodies/pixel-clubs) pages!
- I will also mention that I also added in new links, but seeing as how I seem to *always* add in new links with every update, I figure I won't announce it this time. {% emote 'embarrassed' %}

That's it for now. See you next time!
