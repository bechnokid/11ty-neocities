Whoa, two updates in a week? It's almost unheard of!

Here's what's in today's update!

- [New tutorial]({{ meta.url}}/tutorials/rss-feed)! This one is for adding full descriptions to "prettified" RSS Feeds.
- The old [guestbook]({{ meta.url }}/guestbook) has returned! Yippee!!
- Added a section for [pending webrings]({{ meta.url }}/joined).
- Other fixes such as:
  - Reorganizing and cleaning up a lot of pages
  - Culling some of the quiz results and putting them in my [/about]({{ meta.url }}/about) page.

That's it for now! I hope all of you have a great day!
