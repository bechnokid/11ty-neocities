## New to Feeds?

You can learn more about feeds, which newsreaders to install, and how to subscribe to your favorite webmasters' feeds over at [About Feeds](https://aboutfeeds.com/).

Heather from *Yogo Magpie* also goes into great detail about them, so be sure to check out [her article, too](https://yogomagpie.neocities.org/garden/rss)! There's also a great template you can use.

I personally use [FreshRSS](https://rss.32bit.cafe) (browser) and [Feedbro](https://nodetics.com/feedbro/) (Chrome/Firefox/Edge extension).

## Want to Make Your Own?

Here are a couple of my favorite resources on making your own feeds:

- [Style your RSS feed by Darek Kay](https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-styling/) - shares how to make your RSS pretty and easy for users to read
- [RSS feeds tutorial by Des](https://doqmeat.com/notebook/tutorials/rss/) - also shows how to display RSS feeds on HTML! Super helpful and adorable to boot!
- [RSS feeds tutorial by PKLucky](https://pklucky.neocities.org/coding/rss-tutorial) - provides another template and goes into depth on filling it out!
