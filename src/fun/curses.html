description: A list of clever curses other than "Go to hell".
summary: Once upon a time, a voice actor named P.M Seymour created a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHidPQdqxhs) and stated the following,<br><br>*"'go to hell' is too weak a curse to throw at people, hit them where it hurts like 'I hope all your soups in the future have a faint bad metal taste no matter what you order or make'"*<br><br>Afraid that the YouTube video and original Tumblr post would eventually be lost in the sands of time, I took it upon myself to take all of those curses and put them in a list!
