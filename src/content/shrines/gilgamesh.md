> Enough expository banter! Now we fight like men, and ladies, and ladies who dress like men! For Gilgamesh, it's *morphing time!* {.mx-lg-4 .mb-lg-4 .mt-lg-3 .ps-5 .pe-3 .py-3}

Hello, and welcome to **"The Interdimensional Rift"**, a shrine dedicated to the best (yes, you heard me) Final Fantasy character to exist, the wandering swordman and dimension-hopper, Gilgamesh! No, I will not debate on this, this is fact. (I'm joking...or am I?)

**Two things to keep in mind:**

- This shrine is dedicated to Gilgamesh as he appears in FF7 Rebirth. Before you argue that "every Gilgamesh is the same Gilgamesh", see [my thoughts about this](#is-gilgamesh-the-same-in-all-ff-games).
- It will contain unmarked spoilers for a few Final Fantasy games that he appears in, specifically FFV and FFVII Rebirth. **You've been warned!**

## Intro

Gilgamesh is a character who originated in Final Fantasy V and worked as the captain of the guard to Exdeath, the main antagonist of the game. He is a recurring boss but later becomes an ally to the Dawn Warriors after being banished to the Interdimensional Rift.

Even after his supposed sacrifice and death, Gilgamesh continues to make several appearances in many games since FFV's release in 1992, traveling through the Rift, collecting weapons, battling worthy opponents, and trying to find a way back home. Unlike legacy characters such as Cid, it is implied that almost every Gilgamesh encountered in different games are indeed the same character from FFV. However, I personally find this claim to be rather debatable, which I will discuss later on.

A common running gag in most of his appearances often involve him trying to find a strong weapon (often called "Excalibur") but later finding a much weaker replica ("Excalipoor") instead. As a result, it's common to find him wielding both swords and sometimes dealing only one point of damage to party members (as a boss) or the enemy (as a summon).

His most recent appearance (at the time of writing this in 2025) is in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, where he can be encountered in a series of optional side quests. In the game, the party searches for artifacts called "Protorelics" scattered throughout several regions. These protorelics turn out to be pieces of Gilgamesh's Genji armor. Once the party collects all protorelics, the bladesman can be fought on Gilgamesh Island as a superboss.

Defeating him rewards the player the ability to summon him in battle and additionally partake in extra challenges in Chadley's battle simulator. These challenges also include fighting against a beefed-up virtual Gilgamesh wielding replicas of Cloud's Buster Sword and Sephiroth's Masamune, called "Busted Sword" and "Massy Moony" respectively. Despite the silly names, they are no less dangerous in virtual Gilgamesh's hands.

Although he has departed from the world of Final Fantasy VII, time will only tell if he appears in a future game. With that being said, I really hope he plays a part in the third game of the FFVII Remake trilogy!! T_T

## About

I admit that I am a fairly new Final Fantasy fan. Despite having known of Final Fantasy since 2003, I never got into the series growing up. The first FF game I played was X when I got to play the FFX remaster on my husband's PS3 in 2018, and even then I had only seen Gilgamesh in passing while researching other games. I barely knew anything about him except his name and that he looked and acted like a Kabuki actor.

It wasn't until I watched my wife play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth did I finally discover him. Even though he can show up fairly early in the game depending on your progress in the side quests, I didn't see him until that infamous cutscene in the Nibel region where he was summoned by Sephiroth.

At the time, I wasn't aware that his appearance differered in every game, but I immediately recognized him from his red outfit and the distinctive markings on his face/mask. I still remember gasping in surprise, "Is that--?!! No way!" My wife asked I not spoil who he might've been, so while she was fighting him, I scrambled for my phone to verify that, yes, that was Gilgamesh! I was also not aware of his tendency to appear in other Final Fantasy games, so I remember thinking, "Why is he in this game??? Does he appear in other games??"

I wanted to learn even more about him, and I jumped into the rabbit hole, or rather...the Interdimensional Rift.

Even before seeing him in Rebirth, I knew that Gilgamesh was an idiot, but I assumed that he was a classic "all brawn and no brains" kind of character, which was a type that never interested me. As a result, I didn't bother looking into him much. Huge mistake on my part lmao. My mind was blown after watching a cutscene on YouTube of Cloud's first encounter with Gilgamesh when the former ends up in another dimension. It looks like they were about to start battling when Gilgamesh takes a swipe at Cloud, but not only does he *miss*, but he immediately **runs away at lightning speed** afterwards yelling, "RETREAT!"

I was completely dumbfounded (and so was Cloud)!! Here was this large and intimidating man, at least a foot taller than Cloud, with six arms to boot and who could have EASILY given Cloud a good fight...and yet he retreats!!

It was love at first sight, and I grew to love him even more as I started to play Rebirth and did more obsessive research on him. Gilgamesh fits a type of character that I have always enjoyed: someone who is very silly and a bit of an idiot but is also someone who you should *never* underestimate.

## Why Gilgamesh? { #why-gilgamesh }

Why not? He's such a great character! Even though he is well-known among FF fans, I don't see much love or any mention of him in fandom spaces. He doesn't even get that much merchandise compared to other characters! I can understand why, though.

He's what many fans would call a "gonk", a far cry from the bishounens that Square-Enix have provided such as Cloud Strife, Squall Leonhart, etc. Not to mention that he's extremely hard to draw with his large and stout body type, bulky musculature, complex armor, and multiple arms whose numbers can range from 4 to 8 depending on what game he appears in.

However, I firmly believe that Gilgamesh deserves the spotlight as much as any other character! Like every other Final Fantasy character, he is much more complex than his silly personality makes him out to be. Gilgamesh is 100% a bumbling idiot with one brain cell, but he's still a skilled and formidable swordsman! He knows so much about swords and yet still can't tell Excalibur and Excalipoor apart! How is that possible? I don't know, and I love that about him!!

### Is Gilgamesh the Same in All FF Games? { #is-gilgamesh-the-same-in-all-ff-games }

Yes...and no...at least, I don't think so? A common theory I've heard is that all Gilgameshes are the same and the reason behind their different appearances is to better fit in with whichever world that they enter. I have no doubt that this is stemmed from Kingdom Hearts, where Sora, Donald, and Goofy can have their appearances magically changed depending on the world they enter. I feel that maybe in earlier games, this would have been the case.

However, in the 30+ years that he's been around, I feel more inclined to believe that he has become a legacy character at this point, especially with the number of other characters who are named Gilgamesh but otherwise have very different appearances and backstories from him.

Heck, even the ones who have been dimension-hopping look so different from one another! You have one Gilgamesh who is usually seen with two arms but can morph into an 8-armed form, another who is always seen with six arms, another who is always seen with eight arms, and another who is always seen with four arms but also has two mechanical arms. Don't even get me started on the different skin colors and the horn shapes and placements on each one!

To summarize, I think the dimension-hopping Gilgameshes we've seen so far have similar backstories and personalities, but are ultimately different characters from different dimensions. This is personally what I want to believe because it's a lot better than trying to figure out where each Gilgamesh fits in a "timeline" where there is none in the first place.

I don't ever want to shame fans for wanting to come up with their own theories, but the arguments I've seen pop up regarding Gilgamesh remind me of the ones regarding the grand timeline for the Legend of Zelda, which is a *whole* bag of worms in itself! I just want to give my old brain a break. ^_^;;

### My Favorite Gilgamesh

Although I love every Gilgamesh that has appeared in the games, his appearance in **FF7 Rebirth** is my favorite for a number of reasons. Many of the games that have the original Gilgamesh appear in them seem to mostly use him as fanservice for veteran fans, which is especially evident when he starts randomly making references to other games or reciting the same quotes from FFV. However, Rebirth took Gilgamesh's character to the next level, adding way more depth to him despite his role as "just" an optional boss!

In Rebirth, Gilgamesh speaks in a flowery, almost archaic manner, probably a reference to how samurai spoke in the Edo period. In both Japanese and English dubs, he recites tanka poems, which are usually written in a 5-7-5-7-7 metre. He can write these poems in beautiful calligraphy, as shown right before his final battle with the party, but most of the time, he can recite them on the spot, often reflecting on whatever situation he is in.

I don't know if it's the same with other writers, but I know it takes me hours to be able to write poems, and for him to just easily improvise and write such thought-provoking pieces in seconds is amazing!! It really adds a level of depth to his character, and I love it!

If it sounds like that he is lot cooler than he is and that he's not the same idiotic Gilgamesh, then I'm here to correct you! He's still very much a silly oni with nary a thought in that tiny brain of his! As I have mentioned before in his first encounter with Cloud, his iconic goofiness is still present in Rebirth any time he has appeared. There is also an especially funny scene during the party's final fight with him, but I don't want to spoil it here! [Watch it for yourself!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed6irqLdhog) (volume warning)

I can definitely say that Rebirth managed to achieve a perfect balance between making Gilgamesh funny and terrifying. It makes me a little sad that he might never return to a future FF7R game seeing as how there was a definite end to his boss fight, but a beet can dream!

I had a few OCxCanon ships, but I admit that it wasn't really until 2019 where I finally embraced my "cringe, but free" nature. In May 2024, I declared that I wanted to make an OC to ship with Gilgamesh, and over time she's become one of my most beloved fan OCs! Here's some info about her!

### First Meeting

Siduri and Gilgamesh technically had two "first" meetings. One was when Siduri attempted to scold the Sand Giant for causing major damage to the Gold Saucer's reactors as well as scaring away many of the park's patrons, resulting in pay cuts for all employees, including Siduri.

Siduri was one of the first people brave enough to confront the Sand Giant, but he crumbled away before she got a word in. The two would later meet again on Gilgamesh Island, with Siduri having joined Cloud and his party after overhearing that they would meet the one behind all the damage in the Corel Desert. Siduri managed to force--I mean, convince the bladesman to travel with the party until he pays off his debt.

### Falling in Love

It was a bit of a slow burn for both Siduri and Gilgamesh, as the two did not meet on good terms. In fact, Gilgamesh was designated as a "bodyguard" for the other party members who weren't as skilled in combat as Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Yuffie, and Vincent.

However, the more the party traveled together, the closer the two got over time. Although Siduri found Gilgamesh to be a bumbling idiot at times, she learned that he can be wise and is also surprisingly in-tune with others' feelings, usually knowing the right thing to say.

Despite Gilgamesh having feared Siduri at first, he truly admired her bravery and kindness towards others.

It wasn't until an incident in Junon did the two finally start to develop feelings for the other.

### Confession

Some time after Cloud and Tifa reunite with the party, all of them decided to take some time to prepare for the final battle against Sephiroth, with Gilgamesh and Siduri making their preparations on Gilgamesh Island.

With the world's end becoming more imminent as Meteor inches closer towards the planet, Siduri decided to take the chance and finally confess to Gilgamesh. However, before she was able to do so, Gilgamesh softly took her hands and confessed his love for her.

Though surprised that she got beaten to the punch, Siduri reciprocated his affections with a passionate kiss.

### Gallery

Here's some art I did of these two losers whom I love so very much help me--

**Note**: Gilgamesh in FFVII Rebirth has never taken off his helmet, so the below images have what I *think* he might look. ƪ(˘⌣˘)ʃ
