Hi, everyone! I hope all of you are doing alright.

I went on a week-long vacation with my spouses Sam and Dan to Washington! Not only is WA one of the few states I haven't visited yet, but it's also Sam's home state! We actually went there to celebrate her nephew's high school graduation. However, there weren't enough tickets for the three of us to attend the ceremony, so we opted to visit her family and then just tour around the state whenever we could!

The first place we stopped at before checking into our hotel was Uwajimaya in Renton. This would mark as the first time I've ever been to Uwajimaya, and *oh my lord*, it is beautiful. {% emote 'love' %} Not to sound like a complete weeaboo, but it was so nice getting to see so much Japanese stuff in one place! Sam told me how she would always get the cream horns when she used to live in WA, and I can see why she loved them so much. They're so good!!

I even got to try different kinds of onigiri, including pickled plum. I...can definitely say that I don't want to eat it again lol. {% emote 'dead' %}

Uwajimaya reminded me of another Japanese grocery store that I used to go to when I lived in California called "Mitsuwa", so it brought back some good memories being able to see all of the food and snacks there.

I got to meet Sam's family for the first time, and they were so kind! They really made me feel like I was a part of her family, even with our "unique" relationship. {% emote 'happy' %}

The day after that, we drove around a couple of places where Sam grew up! We even got to visit Twede's Cafe, featured in [*Twin Peaks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks)! {% emote 'excited' %} I hear you can get a damn fine cup of coffee there. Here are some photos (click for full view):

The day after, we visited Sam's mom and stepdad in Ocean Shores! The funniest thing that happened that we found a freaking elk in their front yard??? {% emote 'shock' %} Apparently, deer can almost be compared to common pests in the area. It was so weird to see it just chilling!!

Afterwards, we got to walk on the beach where I found a cool shell and a super smooth rock!! Then, we ate at the restaurant where Sam and Dan ate at when the latter visited Sam for the first time! I was feeling a little sick when we got there, so I just ordered a clam chowder, and MAN was it good chowder!

Here are photos from that day!

] %}

On the next day, we headed down towards Pike Place Market! We got a little bit lost on our way over there, but we at least got to stop by some shops at the pier, and got a few souvenirs to boot!

The excursion drained a lot of my energy (and made me realize that I finally needed a cane...). {% emote 'worried' %} Thankfully, we happened across a little cafe called "Cafe Opla", which I didn't realize was cafe that served a lot of Vietnamese dishes, as well as a mix of other Asian dishes! I ordered myself an ube-flavored Vietnamese coffee, and oh god, I don't think I'll taste a better coffee ever again! {% emote 'love' %}

When we finally reached Pike Place Market, I was just blown away by how amazing everything was in there, especially the fish market! The fish there looked so good!!

Sam best described the market as a "perpetual convention with food and other goods", and I can definitely agree with that sentiment! All the shops in there had their own charm and personality, and I would have bought everything if we weren't already on a budget.

Here are some photos that I took that day!

Overall, I had a truly wonderful time in Seattle! There was so much fun stuff to do, and it was also the first time I got to travel to a different state with my spouses, whereas before I only traveled with my parents and sister. Honestly, the nice weather made me wish we can move there, but that doesn't seem likely due to gentrification. {% emote 'worried' %} At least, there is always the option to visit it!

Hopefully in the future, my spouses and I can travel internationally to Japan, United Kingdom, or another place! I'm really excited!

Thank you for reading this far, and have a great day! 💖
