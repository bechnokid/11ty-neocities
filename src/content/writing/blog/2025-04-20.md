I think a lot about what else I can do for this website, as well as finding ways to bring people from all over the indie web together over a common interest by making a fanlisting directory or a webring.

Yes, I fully plan on making either one of those based on Monster Hunter. XDD

One of the things I've thought of doing is convert this entire site into PHP. A lot of webmasters I've seen have recommended it...or rather, demanded other webmasters to use it, and I can't deny that it picqued my interest, and I've really enjoyed what I've seen so far.

I really like the fact that it allows server-side programming, which is something that I do at work a lot as a full-stack developer. I would be able to create dynamic pages with Javascript disabled, which is a huge plus. Another plus is that PHP can be used with databases, meaning that I don't have to rely on Neocities (or eventually Nekoweb) to store my files.

My only issues are that my site is mostly static, and I've really enjoyed using Eleventy for my site. There's also the fact that I would have to get my own server, which would mean that I would have to move sites. It already took me a year and a half to convert everything for a static site generator to use, and I still haven't been able to upload my art gallery yet, so I'm not willing to make another huge move so soon. {% emote 'worried' %}

There's also the fact that, well...servers usually cost money, and then I would have buy my own domain and database to hold image files and such. I'm financially stable enough to get all of these without putting a huge dent in my wallent, but I also don't think I update the site enough to warrant the eventual yearly costs on top of the other (minimal) subscriptions I already have on my belt.

I honestly wish there were some webmasters that I can get a second opinion from, but it doesn't help that I'm incredibly shy, and I'm scared of being treated like some loser lol. I'll muster up the courage to join 32bit.cafe and ask a few people there eventually!

For now, I'll just keep doing what I'm doing. I know it's possible to make my own webring and directory dedicated to Monster Hunter without using PHP. It'd just take a little more work, and I'm ok with that!
