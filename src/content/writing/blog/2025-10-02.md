Over the past couple of weeks, my spouses and I stumbled upon some Sonic merchandise that I thought I'd never see. A *good2grow* juice bottle with a topper shaped like Shadow the Hedgehog and a giant plush shaped like the classic Sonic ice pop, but it's Shadow instead.

As someone who was obsessed with Shadow the Hedgehog in my pre-teen stage, getting these two ridiculous items brought me inexplicable joy! It's really nice to be able to afford treats like these now and then, even if one of them cost nearly $50 USD. {% emote 'embarrassed' %}

This makes me curious if they'll make more silly items like this for other Sonic characters, namely Metal Sonic. Bonus points if it's Neo Metal Sonic! I've been seeing more of him in the wild, and it's great! I guess we'll just have to see!

The plush kinda smells like chocolate!
