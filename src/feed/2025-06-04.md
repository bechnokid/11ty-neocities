Hi, everyone! Happy Pride Month! ✨🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️✨

Several things for this update!

- I wrote a [rather unhinged review](/writing/blog/2025-06-04) on my thoughts about the Monster Hunter Wilds x Street Fighter collaboration event quest. Spoilers: I didn't like it at all... {% emote 'worried' %}
- I added a new pixel club "[Objets](/goodies/pixel_clubs/#objets)"!
- I'm attempting to get my HTML verified, which is embarrassing that I have the "HTML verified" button up, but there are a few errors. It might take a couple more tries, but hey, I'm always learning!
- I finally got Burning Spice Cookie to join my kingdom, yay!! So, I removed the little widget that was keeping track of how long I've been trying to pull him. {% emote 'happy' %}
