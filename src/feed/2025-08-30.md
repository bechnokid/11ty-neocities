Hi everyone! It's almost September, and while the summer weather is still ever-present, I'm looking forward to the cooler weather that Fall brings!

Here's what's in today's update!

- The [art gallery](/artwork) is finally up! I'll work on adding more before I reach the limit even with a Supporter account!
- Had to remove a few broken fanlistings. {% emote 'worried' %}
- Rearranged a few webrings as well as [added some new ones](/joined).
