Hello! I hope everyone is doing alright! It's almost the weekend!

For this update, I added some more [links](/links), and I changed the URL for all blog entries. The dates being all bunched up confused me more than anything lol...

I'm also biting the bullet and added some [webrings](/joined) despite not having officially joined them yet! Here I was worred about looking like a desperate fool, and yet I have I added a special widget to the [home page](/home) to count the days I'm pulling for a cookie in Cookie Run: Kingdom lol.

Burning Spice Cookie, please come to my kingdom!!!
