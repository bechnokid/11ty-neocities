Hello, everyone! I hope you've all been doing well! It hasn't been too bad, temperature-wise, but that's because I mostly stay inside. I need to get out more...

The newest updates have a lot to do with webrings!

- Added [PersonaRing](/joined)!
- All webrings can be viewed even with JavaScript disabled! This involved me making the buttons myself lol.
- Webring widgets where I'm a pending member will also have more consistent styling.
- Other backend fixes for optimization...at least I hope so!
