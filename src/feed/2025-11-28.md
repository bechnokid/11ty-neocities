Hi everyone! I had a great Thanksgiving and a peaceful Black Friday. Looking forward to the winter holidays now!

Here's what's in this joyous update!

### Major Updates

- New artwork in [Digimon](/art/digimon)
- [FreezeframeJS tutorial](/resources/tutorials/freezeframe):
  - Created a new script
  - Completely rewrote the tutorial on how to use the new script
- [Webgarden](/outgoing/webgarden):
  - Added more pots
  - Slightly updated the layout so I can fit more pots
  - Minor revamp of my own web garden pot. I noticed the spacing would look off in some other's sites, oops.
- [Links](/links):
  - Added more links
  - Added some sections
- Removed FreezeframeJS script and added my own

### Minor Updates

- [About Me](/about) page:
  - Added more favorite Digimon
  - Replaced static Digimon images with moving ones
- [Code Snippets](/resources/code-snippets) page:
  - Added some CSS to allow users to pause the marquee
- Fixed the [Guestbook](/guestbook). I didn't realize it wasn't displaying all of the messages, which I deeply apologize for!
- Other updates and fixes such as:
  - Removed the reliance on margins between items (as much as I can) and replacing them with the `gap` property used in grids and flex boxes.

That's it for now! I hope the holidays don't become stressful to you! You can do it!
