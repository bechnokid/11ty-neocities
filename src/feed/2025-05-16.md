Lots of new updates this time around!

**Major updates:**

- Added a brand new [shrine](/shrines/gilgamesh) dedicated to one of my favorite Final Fantasy characters!
- New button! There are also buttons available in 32x32 and 200x40.
- My RSS feed now looks super fancy, making it easier to read without a feed reader.
- Microblog and "Latest Status" widget have now been placed by StatusCafe to allow myself to make quick status updates without misleading others into thinking I made a huge update on the site. XD;;
- Added a button that allows users to scroll to the top of the page. Yes, it is pure CSS. :3
- Added a [pixel club](/goodies/pixel_clubs) and some [links](/links)!

**Minor updates:**

- Changed the RSS feed icon to its original orange
- Updated the example code in Status Cafe feed reader tutorial to be a bit more robust
- Moved fanlistings and webrings into one page called "Joined"
