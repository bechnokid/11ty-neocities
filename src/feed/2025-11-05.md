Hello, everyone! I hope all of you are doing alright and that seasonal depression has passed for you. If not, then you can do it! I believe in you!

It's gotten colder, but thankfully I like colder weather! It means I can bundle up, wear my longer coats, and look like a real anime protagonist! Ok, not really...

Here are the changes for this update!

- New artwork in the [Digimon](/art/digimon) and [Anime](/art/anime) sections
- Added a section with my currently active social media accounts in [Links](/links)
- New [blog](/blog) entry where I talk about my grievances with sites that repost graphics without giving credit to the original artists
- Finally decided to join more [fanlistings](/joined)!
- Cosmetic updates including:
  - Updating the dark mode colors
  - Adding an icon after external links as well as changing the text color
  - Figuring out how to add line numbers to code blocks for future snippets. This will help in pointing specific lines in any code I share!
  - Moving the Play/Stop GIFs buttons to the navigation bar for easier access
  - Creating a section dedicated to links that don't have buttons. I encourage others to visit those links!!

That's it for now. See you all next time!
