Happy [Dreamspell Festival](https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/20/festival-of-accord-dreamspell-comes-to-monster-hunter-wilds-starting-october-22/) Eve! I honestly wish I would make more of a habit uploading my art here as soon as I finish drawing it, but I love making updates to the site as well! {% emote 'happy' %}

Here are the spooky changes for this update:

- New artwork in the [Digimon](/art/digimon) section
- Added a new [link](/links)
- Added back the [code snippets](/resources/code-snippets) page! The old snippets are no longer there, but there are some new ones! Check them out if you'd like! I'm hoping to update this a little more frequently!
- The [pixel club](/goodies/pixel_clubs) page got a revamp for easier viewing, and I added the Bottlecaps pixel club!
- Added some [honeycomb stamp](/goodies/graphics) graphics! I had been meaning to add them for a while, but making the CSS took a little bit of work!
- Cosmetic updates and other fixes, including:
  - Added a loading screen to graphic-heavy pages
  - I removed most of the {% icon 'alert-triangle', {cls: 'index'} %} icons as a result, but only if JS is enabled! They are still there if JS is disabled!
  - Added [sitemap](/sitemap) to the navigation sidebar for easier access

That's it for now! See you later, and I hope everyone has a great Halloween in 10 days!
