Hi, everyone! It's almost back to school for some of you! I wish you the best in the school period, whether it's a year, semester, quarter. You can do it! {% emote 'happy' %}

Still progressing through getting my art gallery ready. I managed to get to 2012! It's...not great, but progress is progress!

Here are the updates for this site!

- Created a new section, [Status Cafe Themes](/resources/status-cafe/themes)! Not sure if I'll be able to make more themes or just have the one, but we'll see!
  - The Status Cafe Feed Tutorial has also been moved into the same section as the themes. The old links should still work!
- Added two new cliques to the front page: [Barbieland](https://fan.sanguineroyal.com/cli/barbieland/) and [Miasma](https://miasma.dual-weekend.com/).
- New journal entry, ["I'm Not an Ideal Asian"](/writing/blog/2025-08-06), where I discuss my desire for a single crumb of representation as a "non-ideal" Asian American.
- So many backend fixes, including fixing broken links and other things!
