- New items in all [Goodies](/goodies) pages (except for Pocket Bishies) and [Quiz Results](/quiz_results)
- Made some updates to the [webrings](/joined) as well as the [About](/about) page
- Other updates and fixes including cosmetic and backend changes, such as:
  - There should be few to no boxes that have a scroll bar now that I have a "Back to Top" button
