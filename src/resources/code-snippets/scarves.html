{% renderTemplate 'md' %}
In 2012, there was a fad created by [Vanja](https://web.archive.org/web/20121002221021/http://asongofwaterearthfireandair.tumblr.com/scarves) where people decorated their blog with scarves to give others a glimpse into what media they liked and what fandoms they were in. I made a few of these myself!

A few issues with the original code was that they usually only looked good on center-aligned blogs and wasn't entirely beginner-friendly since it required quite a bit of configuration on the user's part. However, I don't fault Vanja for this at all since a lot of modern CSS properties such as flex did not exist during that time. I think he did great with what was available at the time.

So, after feeing nostalgic, I wanted to challenge myself by modernizing the code and also make the scarves entirely in CSS, allowing them to be fully customizable and fit almost any image (recommended size: 25px x 49px).

<div class="scarves" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="scarf [CLASS_NAME1]">

```
- **Line 1**: `aria-hidden` is set to true because these scarves are purely decorative and should not appear in the accessibility API.
  - This applies to the images whose alt texts are set to empty strings.
  - More information about this [can be found here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-hidden).
- **Lines 2 and 5**: the variables that start with CLASS_NAME are optional, but are helpful for setting colors for a particular scarf.

- **Note:** You can set the `.scarves` element's parent element to be any element, not just `body`, as long as it has `position: relative`. You can learn more about CSS positioning over [at this page](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_positioning.asp).
- **Line 142**: If you want the scarves to be on the right side of its parent element, you can put `right: 0` below this line.
