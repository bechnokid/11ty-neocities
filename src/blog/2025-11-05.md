title: I'm Not a Fan of Graphic Collections
---

I've noticed while browsing other personal sites that when webmasters provide a page dedicated to links[[1]](#footnote-1), there's usually always a section dedicated to graphic resources, which usually contain a bunch of reentry pages, carrds, etc. with large collections of graphics. A common pattern I see among those collections is the severe lack of credit or any sight of links that back to the original sources of those graphics.

While there are some images that belong to sites that are no longer available on the web, there are much more that belong to sites that are still up and running. I recognize them immediately, but the people who post these images usually claim to have collected them over time from various online collections and archives that also leave out the sources.

As a result, more webmasters see images that appeal to them and then post these images to their own sites without knowing the sources. Those webmasters then make the same claim that they got them from online collections and archives. Rinse and repeat. {% emote 'worried' %}

I understand that it can be hard to keep track of what images belong to what sites, let alone which of those sites are still running today, so I'm not going to stand on a soapbox and tell others what they should or shouldn't do. Instead, the only thing I'd want to do is encourage webmasters to only save images from collections that actually provide links to the original source. That's how it was when "toyboxes" were (are still??) a thing, so I feel the same should be applied to resource pages with a ton of graphics.

Finding sources can be tedious, but thankfully I always enjoyed doing some research, so I'll share my own process of how I try to find sources for a graphic I like.

## To Save or Not to Save

If I find a graphic I like on a website, I usually consider a few things before saving:

- I check if the graphic has a link attached to it that navigates to the original site.
  - If a link is attached but no longer works, then I put the URL into the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) and see if the site is archived. If so, then I use that archived site as a source when I put the image in my site.
  - A quick way to use the Wayback Machine is to just insert `https://web.archive.org/web/*/` right before the broken link's URL and see if any results come up.
  - If the site has not been archived, then I'll at least make a note somewhere that there's no way of finding the original site again, which is better than nothing!
- If I can't find the link, I'll check if the webmaster actually made the graphic by looking for their rules or terms of service.
- If I don't see any TOS then I check the webmaster's links and/or credits page and see if they have the source listed.

If none of the above steps apply to the graphic of interest, then it's likely that the webmaster reposted the image(s) without providing credit. From here, I decide to check some directories.

## Directories

There are a few great directories out there. Unfortunately, I only know of two. {% emote 'embarrassed' %}

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-2 flex-gap-2">
  {% img "/assets/images/links/ichigo-directory.png", { alt: "Button to the Ichigo Directory", url: "https://directory.cinni.net/" } %}
  {% img "/assets/images/links/sozaidirectory.png", { alt: "Button to Mouseling's Sozai Directory", url: "https://mouseling.net/sozai/" } %}
</div>

Ichigo Directory hasn't updated since 2023 (at the time of writing this), but Mouseling's Sozai Directory has been super helpful and even provides examples for most of the sites listed!

It also helps to check the link pages for whatever graphics/sozai site I go to as well. I often notice on sites like [FOOL LOVERS](https://foollovers.com/) that they would list links to other directories. They are admittedly harder to navigate if your browser can't translate the page for whatever reason, but they're still worth looking through! If any of those sites are broken, it never hurts to use the Wayback Machine!

## If All Else Fails

Then I don't save the graphic, no matter how much I like it. I either decide to look elsewhere or make my own if I can't find anything else.

I'm sure someone will look at this and think this is a lot of work, and yeah it is, but it's honestly better than going through a Rentry, Tumblr, Carrd, or any other site that reposts graphics without credit when some of the original sites are still active.

There's also the benefit of being able to find more sites with possibly even better graphics that one can use for their site, who knows? The possibilities are endless!
