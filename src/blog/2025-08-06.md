title: I'm Not An "Ideal Asian"
summary: Talking about my identity as a Southeast Asian American and how I long for a single crumb of representation.
---

I remember when Sam, Dan, and I went to Katsucon, and we went to a booth that sold some street tech clothing. Both Dan and I joked about how those clothes wouldn't look good on us for a number of reasons. Dan mentioned that he's too tall for those kinds of clothes to ever fit him, and I mentioned that I'm not enough of an "ideal Asian" to look good in those clothes.

He had a confused look on his face and asked me, "What do you mean 'ideal Asian'?"

I responded, "Oh, well...I'm not Chinese, Japanese, or Korean! No one would want to see me in this lmao".

If I'll be honest, despite being a minority (a 2nd-gen Vietnamese American to be precise), representation was never important to me while growing up. I have a giant list of favorite characters who don't look *anything* like me, and that's ok! To me, what makes a good character is not their relatability but how well-written and intriguing they are. I find that making them relatable is nice, but not entirely necessary to make the story interesting. Heck, one of my favorite characters is an [sentient and overly jealous *CAR*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085333/).

However, I understand how important representation it is for viewers who barely get to see themselves in the characters they enjoy. The older I got, the more I wished that I could have seen other Asian American representation that took place somewhere else other than Chinatown.

Asian American representation has definitely gotten better in recent years, but I can't help but still feel like it's rather lacking...specifically in having characters who are Southeast Asian.

## "I Find Your Lack of Faith Disturbing"

I've noticed that whenever I see a promotion of a piece of media with a cast of mostly Asian characters, the characters in question would mostly be Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. Never would they ever be any kind of Southeast Asian. There's no doubt that the respective cultures had a HUGE impact on pop culture in one way or another. Heck, I'm not going to deny that anime consumed my life lmao.

However, I hate to admit that I'm a little tired of seeing creators treating SEAsians as an afterthought when it comes to making Asian American characters. If they aren't making them Chinese, then they're making them Japanese or Korean because the creators grew up with anime and/or K-Pop. Honestly, I've gotten pretty sick of it.

If you don't think it's that bad, then can you think of more than 5 shows/movies that has one or more Asian American characters (main, supporting, etc.) who *aren't* Chinese, Japanese, or Korean?

Sure, there's *Raya and the Last Dragon*, but that movie's setting is more of a fantasy setting that is more or less a melding pot of Southeast Asian cultures instead of an actual location, so I can't count that one unfortunately. {% emote 'worried' %}

Even when there is the *rare chance* that a lead character who is Southeast Asian, there are always going to be supporting Asian characters who are either one of the other East Asian ethnicities, never SEAsian. We have *Amphibia* with the protagonist Anne who is Thai...and one of her best friends is Chinese. We have *The Ghost and Molly McGee* with the protagonist Molly who is half-Thai...and her crush/boyfriend is Chinese.

I'm not asking for all shows to have at least one SEAsian character, mind you. It's like I said near the beginning that representation shouldn't be solely what makes a piece of media intriguing. However, if we're going to advocate for more positive representation of queer people, POCs, queer POCs, etc., then is it really asking too much for the same treatment towards Southeast Asian characters?

## Silver Lining

I don't want to make this article too negative, so I'll talk about some good instances of Viet representation I've seen so far!

So far, the best Vietnamese American representation I've seen is in *Fairly Odd Parents: A New Wish* of all places! Jasmine Tran is a supporing character who becomes best friends with protagonist Hazel in the second episode and has made consistent appearances since then! Also, she isn't just there as the token Asian character. She's a well-established character who is outgoing and funny, with an adorable quirk of being a bad singer despite her love for singing!

Another piece of media that I'm really looking forward to is [*Crazy Broke Asian*](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/parlous-house/crazy-broke-asian-a-6-part-docuseries-incorporating-2d-animation). I happened to come across the trailer on my YouTube feed. I chuckled at the obvious parody in the title and was curious enough to click on it, and so I did. I was happy to see that not only was there someone who was in the process of creating a docuseries as a Asian (North) American, but that someone was a 2nd-generation Vietnamese (North) American...just like me.

Here's the sypnopsis:

>This is the story of Celin who grew up as a **closeted, failed med student** struggling with **undiagnosed ADHD and depression**. But upon meeting THE LOVE OF THEIR LIFE, Celin finds the motivation to move out of their traditional Vietnamese household and follow their repressed dream of becoming a ***WORLD CLASS ARTIST.***
>
>The journey is by no means easy… but Celin decides to make life harder by filming everything (yes, EVERYTHING) to turn their journey into ~~an American~~ a Canadian Dream movie to ~~prove their parents wrong~~ win their parents approval.

Although our career paths took wildly different turns, there were many parts of the trailer that made me sob like this:

{% figure "/assets/images/blog/2025-08-06_denji.png", { alt: "An edit of Denji from the Chainsaw Man manga crying while watching TV. His dialogue reads, &quot;Oh...he just like me...He just like me fr!!!&quot;", cls: 'figure-center figure-landscape my-3' } %}
"He just like me fr!!!!"
{% endfigure %}

I can definitely say that I'm looking forward to this and will do my best to help support the project! How can I not???

## Closing Words

I might be putting too much emphasis on wanting representation despite claiming that it was "never important to me" while growing up. After all, good representation shouldn't be the only thing that a story has going for it, and character writing shouldn't have depend solely on their relatability.

However, I won't deny that it would be nice to have seen American TV shows in my childhood that would make small references to Vietnamese culture in some shape or form. Just a little something to let me know that even if I'm not an "ideal Asian", I'm not alone!

Please, just one mention of phở restaurants, and I'll be over the moon!! {% emote 'sad' %}
