Hi! I'm **Bechno Kid**.

Don't be fooled by the "kid" in the name! I came up with it when I was a [wee beet](/faq) and it has stuck since then even as an adult lol.

I work full-time as a software developer, and I live with my two spouses and one dogger. I've been [drawing](/CHANGEME) for at least 20 years where I mostly dabble in character design and expressions.

I also enjoy a little bit of [coding](/CHANGEME) and, while I'm not an expert, I do enjoy sharing my findings with others, and I sometimes like to ramble about things I [love](/CHANGEME), things I find interesting, frustrating, or anything that evokes my desire to [write](/CHANGEME) about it!
