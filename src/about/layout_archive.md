Finally made a layout for the home page that I'm happy with! I also made some subtle changes for the headers throughout the site for a bit more consistency!

A minor upgrade! This one was mostly to clean up the previous layout's really messy CSS.

The very first layout! Inspired by [Rina Cat's Domain](http://web.archive.org/web/20041206135411/rinacat.com/main.html).
