summary: I've gotten a lot of questions over the years. Many of them are asked pretty often, which is why I created this page! If you have another question that you don't see on this page, feel free to [email me](mailto:bechnokid@yahoo.com).

## Me
Where did the name "Bechno Kid" come from?
: My sister and her friend group came up with several nicknames for themselves. As a lonely middle-schooler, I always wanted a cool name. I originally went with "Techno Kid" but somewhere along the way, I went with "Bechno Kid".

What does "Bechno" mean?
: It doesn't really mean anything! It's a word I made up, but I think it sounds pretty neat!

## Art

What kind of tools/software do you use for your art?
: Clip Studio Paint with an Intuos Bamboo CTH-480 tablet for drawing, and Photoscape for any final edits!

When will you open commissions again?
: I'm not sure, but I always make a post on all my social media sites before opening commissions!

Is there a way to support your work without commissioning you?
: I have a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/A34588W) if you'd like to donate! Otherwise, you can support me by blogging/retweeting my artwork (Tumblr/Twitter) or sharing this website!

Are you open for art trades/requests?
: Due to my limited time, I cannot take any more art trades or requests! I might take suggestions if they are related to my current interests, but that is a big *"might"*.

Can I use your art for icons/headers/banners?
: Definitely! As long as it's fanart (excluding gift art and commissions) and you give proper c redit, such as providing a link back to any of my socials. The only thing I ask is that you don't use art that contain any of my own characters, fan or original!

Can I trace your work?
: Sure, but only if it's for practice! All I ask is that you don't post it publicly.

Can I draw fanart of your characters?
: Absolutely! <3 All I ask is that you don't draw anything NSFW or fetish-related.

Any chance you'll draw ______ again?
: It's not likely if it's something I haven't drawn in a while since my interests tend to fluctuate a lot.

## Fandom

Have you watched/played/heard of ______?
: Maybe, or maybe not! I'd rather not be asked these kinds of questions!

What do you think of ______?
: I probably won't know enough to give an opinion, I'm sorry! However, if you have a question related to a current or previous interest, then ask away!

Are you a proshipper or an anti?
: -shrugs- I'm not a fan of a lot of things that people consider to be problematic (incest, noncon, power imbalance, etc.). In fact, those topics make me extremely uncomfortable. However, I don't go out of my way to look for artists/writers to harass or send death threats to. The most I would do is report someone, but that's only if they are actively hurting people (i.e. grooming or abusing minors).
