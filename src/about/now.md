summary: Inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about), I think it'd be nice to make this page!

## Who Am I?

**Software developer** and **semi-professional artist**.

By day, I am a full-stack software developer, which means that I work on both the backend (the coding) and the frontend (UI) of the application that I'm assigned to. It's fun and I'm learning new things every day.

By night (and weekends), I am an artist who enjoys drawing but am usually too tired to get anything done that night, so I usually end up playing video games lol. But that's ok. I'm in no rush to draw/post anything for my social media profiles.

I have done a total of three small gigs for an animation project, two of which include [designing t-shirts](/blog/20221203/). I think that's a pretty big accomplishment!

## Where Am I?

Somewhere on the **east coast of the United States**.

I have no plans on moving anywhere else except for maybe a better house that's a bit closer to where I work. Otherwise, I'm quite comfortable here.

We are currently in the process of getting our storm door fixed after a stray rock shattered the entire thing. Our next plan is to fix the chimney so that we're not at risk of setting our house on fire. We don't even use the fireplace, but better safe than sorry. Our current dream is to have our backyard and deck renovated into a place where we can hang outside at our bonfire...playing video games. Some things never change with us.

Online...I barely have a presence. I'm mostly retweeting interesting or funny things I see on Twitter and talk to a few friends through DMs. Although since Twitter has now become "X", **we're all fleeing to BlueSky**. It's nice over there, but I imagine it's harder for others to see what I'm up to and what art I've been posting. All the more reason to keep updating this site!

Despite being a member of several Discord servers, I'm barely online as it is. It kinda sucks that a lot of important or useful information is locked behind walls of nearly unsearchable text. I miss forums!

## What Am I Doing?

### Art

- Still filling out that old DeviantArt meme! When will it be finished? Someday...
- I'm also still thinking about doing that color wheel challenge. I'll be late, but -shrugs-
- Making some gijinkas of some Pokémon I befriended in Pokémon sleep!

### Site

- Using Eleventy to its fullest to help me work on this site! It seems to be working. :3
- Uploading 2016 art onto the site. Slowly but surely going!
- Still planning on converting a Tumblr game into its own page. Maybe I won't need to use Javascript for it anymore? We'll see!

### Media

### Personal

- Bought a special mechanical keyboard!! I'll have to make a new blog post when I can.
- I learned about minimalist/barefoot shoes and how most modern shoes restrict our toes, which can have lasting health issues in the long run, so I'm thinking of getting a pair of transitional ones to help out my poor feet. Or maybe I should just stick to wearing toe separators each day to save money haha
