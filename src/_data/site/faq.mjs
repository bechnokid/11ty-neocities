    {
      q: "Where did the name \"Bechno Kid\" come from?",
      a: "My sister and her friend group came up with several nicknames for themselves. As a lonely middle-schooler, I always wanted a cool name. I originally went with \"Techno Kid\" but somewhere along the way, I went with \"Bechno Kid\"."
    },
    {
      q: "What does \"Bechno\" mean?",
      a: "It doesn't really mean anything! It's a word I made up, but I think it sounds pretty neat!"
    },
    {
      q: "What's that thing on your head?",
      a: "It's my mask! It's based off of those cute masks you could give to your Chao in the Sonic Adventure games!"

  "Art": [
    {
      q: "What kind of tools/software do you use for your art?",
      a: "Clip Studio Paint with an Intuos Bamboo CTH-480 tablet for drawing, and Photoscape for any final edits!"
    },
    {
      q: "When will you open commissions again?",
      a: "Probably never since I just don't have the time anymore! If I ever do decide to open commissions again, I will make sure to make an announcement post at least a few days in advance!"
    },
    {
      q: "Is there a way to support your work without commissioning you?",
      a: "You can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/bechnokid) if you'd like! Otherwise, you can support me by blogging/retweeting my artwork if you use any social media site, or you can share URLs that link to my artwork! That always helps. :D"
    },
    {
      q: "Are you open for art trades/requests?",
      a: "Due to my limited time, I cannot take any more art trades or requests! I might take suggestions if they are related to my current interests."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I use your art for icons/headers/banners?",
      a: "Definitely! As long as it's fanart (excluding gift art and commissions) and you give proper credit, such as providing a link back to any work."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I trace your work?",
      a: "Sure, but only if it's for practice! Just make sure that you don't post it publicly."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I draw fanart of your characters?",
      a: "Absolutely! <3 All I ask is that you don't draw anything NSFW or fetish-related."
    },
    {
      q: "Any chance you'll draw ______ again?",
      a: "It's not likely if it's something I haven't drawn in a while since my interests tend to fluctuate a lot."

    {
      q: "Have you watched/played/heard of ______?",
      a: "Maybe, or maybe not! I'd rather not be asked these kinds of questions!"
    },
    {
      q: "What do you think of ______?",
      a: "I probably won't know enough to give an opinion, I'm sorry! However, if you have a question related to a current or previous interest, then ask away!"
    },
    {
      q: "Are you a proshipper or an anti?",
      a: "Neither, since I'm too old to get involved in meaningless discourse. I won't touch things like incest, noncon, power imbalance, age gaps between a minor and an adult with a thirty-nine-and-a-half-foot pole, but I don't go around harassing people about it. If you don't bother me, then I won't bother you. In fact, I'll stay so far away from you that you won't even know I exist. Sounds like a good deal, right?"
