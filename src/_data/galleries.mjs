I thought I could give it a try with the SUPER BROS. Would you believe me if I told you that I kept listening to Big Time Rush's songs while drawing this? Also, I wanted to make it special and put them in the order that I obtained them.\n\nI guess in the Pokémon gijinka world, the teams from each city gym would be named after the city. For example: Violet Town's gym team would be Team Violet and what not. For the Elite Four, the team names would mean something after the original Elite Four members' names. For example: Koga might have come from Koga-Ryu, a school for ninjutsu, so Koga's team would be named Team Koga-Ryu, or something along those lines, I guess."

I stalk the Keroro Gunso RP group a little bit after getting comments from several of the characters.

I SHOULD TRY DRAWING ALL OF THE SEASONS WITH HUMAN VERSIONS OF THE KERONIANS.\"\n\nIt was not easy trying to find the last two Keronians to represent the other seasons, but I finally decided to go with Samama and Kabobo.\n\nSamama is supposed to be a Keronian who looks just like one of the main characters: Natsumi. Ironically, Natsumi is a derivative of \"summer\" and Samama's own name can be pronounced as \"summer\". SO WHY NOT? Because Natsumi is often associated with fire, I thought it'd be the same with her Keronian counterpart.\n\nAs for Kabobo, his name is short for \"kabocha\", which is Japanese for \"pumpkin\" (much thanks to chocolatebananapop for correcting me!).

But then I realized that I can't hate the anime shows I used to watch as a kid. They were too good to be hated.\n\nOne of them was Digimon. Dang, that show was good,and I still have some old videos that my sis and I would record. ❤️ I have some episodes from all 4 seasons. Ha, good times.\n\nBut anyway, besides that, I just wanted to draw one of my favorite characters from the series, Wizardmon. And in case you didn't know, I needed to watch ALL of the episodes that he appeared in to be able to get references for his costume. xDD\n\nI hope that all of you enjoy this, just as much as I enjoyed drawing and coloring this."

				originalCaption: "I don't know what to consider this: either a contest entry for or giftart for him. If this is not acceptable for him, then I'll consider this giftart. :D\n\nHere's some reasons why this is a contest entry. I've always wanted to participate in Endling's contests, but I was always afraid that they would not be good enough, but this time, I took a risk and made this. If this is acceptable as a contest entry then this will be in Category: F: Free-for-all.\n\nHere are some reasons why this is gift art. Dude. Endling is such a great guy to talk to, man. He must be one of the only popular artists who talks like a regular nice guy. Every conversation I have with him is like talking to a good friend, not an artist. He was what inspired me to be nice to everyone, no matter if you're popular or not. And he has such great art, too. He says that he's still improving. Dude, his art makes me explode from amazement right now, and if he says that he's still improving, then I don't know what will happen to me in the future. He's that awesome, man. You need to see his art right now. And since, he has been such a great guy to talk to I just wanted to make a pic for him to let him know how wonderful he is.\n\nNow, about this pic, this is basically a silly group picture with Endling's classic Fairy Tale character, Little Red, and my own characters, Jack and Jill. I've seen Little Red many times as a serious person in many pics. So why not make a colorful and silly group picture with other of the classic Fairy Tale characters? xD\n\nI'll give bios about Jack and Jill if you guys want me to.\n\nSorry for the long description, folks. ",
				caption: "Jack and Jill started out as fan OCs of Endling's webcomic [\"Ever After\"](https://www.snafu-comics.com/ea/page-1)! That comic is so delightfully edgy, and I'm a little sad that it stopped updating, but I know the artist has moved on to better things!"

I'm actually proud of how this resulted in.\n\nI also have been drawing out new designs for guns and cannons. I still suck, but hey.

I began to love the little guy when I first saw him. He was so adorable, because of the way he looked, and the way how he sounded. It's funny how a lot of heartless look like Vivi. XD\n\nI started this pic a week ago, but couldn't finish it because of homework. Not only was I practicing how to draw Vivi, but I wanted to thank you all for the pageviews. It's almost 4,000 and I want to thank all of you guys for that.\n\nOverall, this pic was basically practice to see if I could do some nature for once. I've been messing around with Photoshop and got this. Isn't that funny? Enjoy the pic, while I suffer my head off trying to do the pixel art requests."
