While a lot of things suddenly make sense, things are pretty much going to stay the same, and I'm content with that."

I won't explain too much, but let's just say that my partners and I had to clean up A LOT that Friday... I got a text from one of my sisters this morning asking if I was going to come home for Thanksgiving. I said, 'no' and I still feel pretty bad. Maybe I'll make up for it and give her a call beforehand."

I remember telling my sister that my favorite character is Rika, but I didn't tell her that it was only because my sister liked her lol. My favorite is actually Jeri.:3"

I've been keeping track of how much I'm taking care of him since apparently you need to make a couple of mistakes to get some characters. Thankfully, getting Maskutchi means that you can let him be a little bit of a naughty boy while still giving him perfect care! x3"

We were talking about some Tamagotchis we raised when we were younger, and she remembered one who she claimed looked just like Bill Gates. Sure enough, her Tamagotchi's name is Bill! What are the odds? We found him really endearing...at least in his US artwork. His JP artwork is....eugh."

In other news, I learned how to crochet over the weekend just so I could make a little cozy for my Tamagotchi. I've been obsessed with these little guys; they're like my new hyperfixation and I don't know how to feel about this lol. I might have to make a shrine at some point, but in the meantime, I'm really excited for the Tamagotchi I ordered that is the same model as the very first Tamagotchi I owned!"
