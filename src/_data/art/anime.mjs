      altText: "Ryuko and a human Senketsu from a future AU for Kill la Kill attending a tanabata festival. Senketsu laments not being able to come up with a wish to write on the tanzaku (piece of paper). Ryuko playfully suggests for him to wish to be a sailor uniform again. Senketsu then admits that he might have written that last year, but has since changed his mind, expressing how happy he is with how things are now and hopes it remains that way. He then makes quip saying that Ryuko can't wear a sailor uniform forever, to which Ryuko asks, \"Says who?\"",
