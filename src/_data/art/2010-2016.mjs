I thought I could give it a try with the SUPER BROS. Would you believe me if I told you that I kept listening to Big Time Rush's songs while drawing this? Also, I wanted to make it special and put them in the order that I obtained them.\n\nI guess in the Pokémon gijinka world, the teams from each city gym would be named after the city. For example: Violet Town's gym team would be Team Violet and what not. For the Elite Four, the team names would mean something after the original Elite Four members' names. For example: Koga might have come from Koga-Ryu, a school for ninjutsu, so Koga's team would be named Team Koga-Ryu, or something along those lines, I guess."

I stalk the Keroro Gunso RP group a little bit after getting comments from several of the characters. I remember that someone who played Hanana mentioned something about Hanana representing the season of spring and Yukiki representing the season of winter. Then I thought, \"HEY. I SHOULD TRY DRAWING ALL OF THE SEASONS WITH HUMAN VERSIONS OF THE KERONIANS.\"\n\nIt was not easy trying to find the last two Keronians to represent the other seasons, but I finally decided to go with Samama and Kabobo.\n\nSamama is supposed to be a Keronian who looks just like one of the main characters: Natsumi. Ironically, Natsumi is a derivative of \"summer\" and Samama's own name can be pronounced as \"summer\". SO WHY NOT? Because Natsumi is often associated with fire, I thought it'd be the same with her Keronian counterpart.\n\nAs for Kabobo, his name is short for \"kabocha\", which is Japanese for \"pumpkin\" (much thanks to chocolatebananapop for correcting me!). I THINK THAT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS. I wanted to create a Halloween-esque background for him to fit the season.\n\nTL;DR: All in all, I had a fun time coloring this out. All I can say is...YUKIKI YOU SEXY BASTARD. >8C DON'T QUESTION ME.\n\nONE LAST THING IN CASE ANYONE IS CONFUSED.\n\n<ul><li>Yukiki = \"yuki\" = \"snow\"</li><li>Hanana = \"hana\" = \"flower\"</li><li>Samama = \"summer\"</li><li>Kabobo = \"kabocha\" = \"pumpkin\"</li></ul>",

I still have a lot of practice to do, but this was decent for a first and completed try.\n\nANYWAY! This pairing makes absolutely no sense and yet it does.
