A Cat as White as Snow|200912russiaartemis.jpg||||A colored pencil piece of a white cat nuzzling up to Ivan Braginski from Hetalia||Apparently, from the filename says that the white cat is Artemis? I wish I could remember the original context of this piece! Also, yes, I was into Hetalia for a hot minute. I'd rather not bring up those days again. xDD|
Gogglehead|200912jackspicer.jpg|December 2009|||Jack Spicer from Xiaolin Showdown making a very confident pose|After seeing [REDACTED]'s (somewhat) recent pic of Jack Spicer while in an art block, I decided to draw him to quell that blasted block. It worked! A little. But that's always good.\n\nI'm honestly too embarrassed to show any of my old drawings of Jack, but I guess I'll show it anyway.\n\n([link](/assets/images/2009-2003/200505jackspicer&wuya.jpg)) From mid-2005. SGHASLDJFASHFSJF SO LONG AGO. I used to draw so stiff back then.|I wonder if I should try drawing Jack Spicer again lol.|
-+ LET'S DANCE +-|200910rinandlen.jpg|October 2009|||A bright lineless piece of Rin and Len Kagamine|VOCALOID? IN MY GALLERY? This is more likely than you think.\n\nNot only does this represent my recent admiration for Vocaloid, but this is dedicated to my very good friend Pumpkin-Girl! ❤️\n\nShe was unfortunately diagnosed with carpel tunnel syndrome just recently, and I wanted to do something SUPER DUPER awesome for her. So, I thought, "Why not draw her favorite Vocaloid characters Rin and Len Kagamine and make it a vector AND a wallpaper while I was at it?"\n\nAND SO, THE RESULT IS THE PIECE YOU SEE BEFORE YOU.\n\nI hope that you feel better, Adori! Take care of yourself and don't give up! <333||
Rosa - Evening Gown|200907rosaeveninggown.jpg|July 2009|||Rosalivia in a satin-like evening gown that has a gradient from black at the top to pinkish red towards at the bottom. She is also wearing red opera gloves and a sheer and glittery red sash while holding a small pink hand purse.|It's funny. My older sister inspired Rosa's personality, but I didn't know that she would subconciously inspire me for Rosa's body type, also. 8|\n\nWhen it came to the second round, I was absolutely stumped in coming up with the dress design. Then I kept thinking about what my older sister wore to her Homecoming and Prom. They had very dark colors, and had some sort of a unique design that works with the body. LOVE YA, SIS. YOU INSPIRE ME EVERYDAY.\n\nI keep noticing how tall Rosa looks when she's in these entries. I'm sure you noticed too, guys. Wow. Her original outfit and standing next Etahis seems to have given that odd illusion that she's shorter. But she really is 5'6" (about 167 cm).\n\nOH. And I'm not sure if this is allowed...but I got the curtains from a previous entry from a different contest last year. 8DDD;;; So sorry! It won't happen again!|
Miss OC Pageant: Poise|200905rosaocpageant.jpg|May 2009|||A contest entry for Miss OC Pageant. Rosalivia is in a graceful pink dress with several broken heart motifs. The background has two large pink curtains and a stained glass pattern.|8DD;;; I was afraid that I wouldn't get this done.\n\nThis is my submission for the lovely contest at "Miss OC Pageant" starring Rosalivia! 8DDD I BET THAT YOU GUYS TOTALLY DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. </sarcasm>\n\nHonestly, Rosa is one of the only characters I have who would look good in a gown and stuffs. I already had Jill enter a beauty contest before, so now it's Rosa's turn. YAAAAAAAY. I wanted to show that Rosa knows how to look elegant and formal, even though she may be a crazy spaz of a dictator at times. OMG, IS THAT LIPSTICK. Yes. It is. Be surprised that she's going to show her mouth in this contest. After that, SHE WILL SHOW IT NEVERMORE. >8C\n\nI had a lot of fun drawing this out. I didn't know that painting with pinkish colors would be so fun. Urm....ENJOY, DUDES. ROCK OUT.\n\nNow, I need to finish that art trade. I was having so much fun drawing it out until I realized that I had an actual deadline. xDDD;;;|I do *NOT* like how thin Rosa's neck is in this piece XDD|
TEGAKI: You Crazy Child.|200904hugewatermelon.jpg|April 2009|||An image of King Dedede and Kirby as humans. Kirby is attempting to eat a whole watermelon and King Dedede looks concerned|Drawn in Tegaki J.\n\nThis took me way longer than necessary, but I'm very happy with the overall result. YES, I'M STILL DOING FANART. I can't get rid of this disgusting fangirlism I have inside me.\n\nOh, and I'm going to actually request critques for the first time. I know there are some mistakes in here that I was too blind to see and I want to hear what you guys would say about it. 8D\n\nThanks!||
+Let's Go to the Axiom+|200811wallecharactershuman.jpg|November 2008|||Humanizations of the robots from Pixar's WALL-E. From left to right: WALL-E, EVE, M-O, AUTO|Man, I'm on an updating roll.\n\nAnyways, have some human!Wall-E chibi-things. I have to admit, they're not easy to personify.\n\n*"Eeee-va!"*|I can't begin to tell you the chaos that this single image had wrought lmao... |
Heartbreakers|200809rosaliviaandetahis.jpg|September 2008|TRUE||An image of Rosalivia and Etahis from the original story "Loveless Empire". Rosalivia is on the right looking menacingly at the camera while Etahis is looking elsewhere with a stoic expression.|I'm sure that you guys have seen Rosalivia around in my gallery. If not, then here she is again. I swear, she is one of the only OC's that has gone through the most changes considering her design. I was never satisfied with her outfit until now. She has gone through drastic changes as you can tell. Sometimes I can't believe that this is her from 2006....([link](/assets/images/artwork/2009-2003/200602rosalive.jpg)) xDD Man, oh, man.\n\nAnd Etahis here is a total revamp from this in 2005: ([link](/assets/images/artwork/2009-2003/200502shiate.jpg)) That was basically a Nights rip-off and originally a girl LOL. I didn't want this...thing to be a dead character, so I thought I could revamp it into a much more useful person. Notice how I still kept his old colors and that his name is simply an anagram of his old name, Shiate.\n\nNow, I'd like to tell these guys' descriptions.\n\nRosalivia thinks that love is always corrupt and causes ruin upon everything. In becoming banished from her former world and later destroying it, she went on a rampage to make sure she gets what she wants. So she plans to create an empire void of all love by conquering worlds one by one using her almighty power. She already has an army of creatures born from nightmares and broken hearts assisting her in making sure everything goes according to plan.\n\nEtahis is a creature of an unknown species. He was also banished from his world for his diabolical schemes to conquer it. This exile almost brought upon his death until Rosalivia found him. Rosalivia noticed his high intellect and power, and so she decided to recruit him as her right-hand man. A rather emotionless being, Etahis takes his work seriously and is always making sure everything goes as planned, even if it means going as far as killing anyone who stands in his leader's way.\n\nI don't feel like revealing too much about them, yet. Perhaps when I make some ref sheets for them.\n\n |It's hilarious that Rosa's design seems to change every other year while Etahis has remained the same lmao. |
Miss SDL: Final Round|200807mssSDLfinalround.jpg|July 2008|||A final contest entry for the Miss SDL (Samurai Dualers League) Pageant with Jill in a regal blue dress. She is in a castle and sitting on the window looking outside to the night sky at the moon with the moonlight reflecting on the ocean below it|Unfinished. I'm going to disable comments for now until later.\n\nFinal Round Entry for Miss SDL on RoninsUltramix\n\n"Do you prefer a direct kill, or a gory bloodbath complete with flying body parts while the victims family looks on in horror?"\n\n"Oh, boy.....I don't like to kill people at all, unless I have to, though I won't like it at all. But if I am to do so. I would have to do a direct kill. So then, I won't have to see the poor victim suffer so much. Haha...this was a difficult question..." |I can't remember why I said this was "unfinished" when it already looks gorgeous! I guess it will remain a mystery. |
Miss SDL: Elegance|200804missSDLkimono.jpg|April 2008|||A contest entry for the Miss SDL (Samurai Dualers League) Pageant with Jill in a blue kimono. She is holding a paper parasol while siting in a cherry blossom tree.|My entry for RoninsUltramix's Miss SDL Pageant.\n\nOHOHO. I practically did this at the very last minute. xDD I'm really surprised that I was able to finish this, with the piece looking exactly how I wanted it to look like. I'm quite happy, CAN YOU NOT TELL? 8D\n\nSo basically, round 1 of the pageant required the OC to have a kimono designed by the artist. I actually did research on the Japanese kimonos. For the design of the kimono, I had these downloaded brushes from someone, but I forgot whom, but I give credit to them. :]\n\nDesigning the kimono was....not easy. I had to choose the design carefully to make it look nice and authentic. I learned that kimonos are supposed to have clashing colors, and I was like, "I DUNNO HOW TO DO THAT" since I've always had colors be complimentary to each other. So this was hard. I even had her kimono green for a while. xDD\n\nAlso, since the theme was Elegance, I was freaking out since it's hard to imagine the crazy, fun-loving Jiru/Jill that way. So I tried my best. xDDD\n\nI'm not sure if I could make it through round 1, but all I know is that I had fun doing this. Especially the cherry blossom tree. DAGNAB, those trees are beautiful. :'>\n\nThanks for taking a looksee! |Despite using the wrong brush for the petals, I absolutely love how this looks even after all these years! |
Noogies|200802noogie.jpg|February 2008|||A group piece of humanizations of bosses from Super Mario Sunshine. From left to right: Gooper Blooper (laughing at the situation), Petey Piranha (giving Wiggler a noogie), Wiggler (the receiver of the noogie), and King Boo (being annoyed at the situation)|Who knew that school doodles would turn into pieces like these?\n\nThese are my own humanizations of the four main bosses of Super Mario Sunshine, besides Bowser that is. Even if I did put him in there, he just wouldn't fit somehow.\n\nFrom left to right is Gooper Blooper, Petey Piranha, Wiggler, and King Boo.\n\nWhat I find so funny is that Wiggler is the biggest boss in the game (excluding Bowser), yet I made him so tiny as a human. I don't know, but seeing him angry reminds me of a little kid having a tantrum. xD ||
At The Bus Stop|200802busstop.jpg|February 2008|||Jack, Jill, and Mr. Happy at a bus stop. Jack approaches Mr. Happy and asks him, "Sir, if we are not too much trouble, could you possibly assist us to find the location of the most adjacent hotel?" Mr. Happy stares at Jack while thinking, "Darn kids. Running away from home and talking in geek vocabulary at such a young age." Jill is seen getting distracted by a purple butterfly on her head.|Jack and Jill meet Mr. Happy for the first time. EPIC, MUCH?\n\nHaha, this was pretty much drawn after I saw the prize that Pumpkin-Girl gave me. She drew the crazy duo with modern clothes, which I found so spectacular that I just HAD to draw them. Seriously, the outfits that she gave them were so adorable! 8DDD\n\nPlus, I wanted to see how their first encounter with Mr. Happy would be when he just finished his job. This was another excuse of drawing Mr. Happy because of the wonderful mug that Zody gave to him. xDDDD |Fun fact about this piece! I did the lineart in Adobe Flash! Ah...the days where lines in Flash was one of the only ways to have clean and crisp lines lol. |
Star Light, Star Bright|200712zodiac.jpg|December 2007||TRUE|A group picture of femme humanizations of the western Zodiac. From left to right, top to bottom: Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, and Capricorn|"""Bechno Kid is lame at titles. LAWL"" Shhh....let's keep that secret between you and me.\n\nI did my interpretation of the ZODIAC. No, not the Chinese one. I'll do that later. This was quite an interesting challenge. :]\n\nThis was also an experiment to not make the outfits too revealing, since I've seen that happening with a lot of fantasy girls. AM I RIGHT? Eck, I'm gonna get killed for this. xD\n\n<ul><li>First row: Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer</li><li>Second row: Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn</li>\n\nI've been working on this for WEEKS, and trust me, this was not easy. I don't get how some people can make amazing pieces EVERYDAY. *admires them greatly* ❤️\n\nHOLY CPU, BATMAN. THIS PIC IS ABOUT 1,168 KILOBYTES. D:"|This piece really is huge!! It took a while to figure out how to compress it without it looking too ugly! |
Mew Mew Style, Mew Mew Grace...|200709mewmews.jpg|September 2007|||A group picture of the main characters from Tokyo Mew Mew|Mew Mew Power in your face! I have to say, everytime I hear this, I crack up. xDD\n\nWhat's this? Bechno Kid actually drew something from an anime even though she says that she hates it? D8 Yep, but it's not like that I hate all anime/manga. I mostly hated anime/manga because it kept bringing back the worst memories when I was in middle school. I really don't like to talk about it. xDD\n\nHowever, there were some that brought back very good memories, such as Sailor Moon, Digimon, and Tokyo Mew Mew. So I thought I could do a little experiment to possibly draw them cartoony as a little tribute. It was quite fun. >:] |I'm glad younger me started embracing anime a bit more! xD |
The Dark Side Looks Scary...|200708penelope.jpg|August 2007|||A black and red piece of Penelope (OC) and her darker side above her. Large, blob-like shadows are sprouting form her oversized sleeves with several wailing spirits in the background. Penelope is in the front with a nervous expression.|Ever wondered what would happen if you look at Endling's pics for too long? Then you get this. xDD\n\nUgh, man. I hope that Endling and everybody else doesn't think that this is too much of a rip-off. I was actually trying to do some experimenting with PS and my tablet to see if I could do some art that's dark or something. It's a wee bit too colorful to be dark, but I still love it. xD\n\nThis is just something of a character I created named Penelope. She's around 8-10 years old methinks. Penelope is like a typical little girl who likes making friends and being cheerful. But her family curse can make her quite the opposite.\n\nOne more thing, I hope that I put this in a good category. xDD|I miss having edgy OCs! |
Pokemon Chase|200708bagnapped.jpg|August 2007|||A chase scene in a forest with Charlie (Tentacool) and an Aipom gijinka. Aipom is running away while holding a bag, and Charlie is chasing after them with a wave of water behind him.|My entry for the awesome Pokecon contest. Ok, ok, I have to admit, I was quite bored and I felt guilty for not drawing Charlie the Tentacool often so this is to make it up.\n\nIn here, an Aipom just stole Zaphk's character Korin's bag. Charlie was walking along and saw how devastated Korin looked after his bag was stolen. After all, if your bag had all of your pokeballs and stuff in there, you would be devastated if it was stolen, too. xD So Charlie soon became a hero and went after that Aipom.\n\nOk, so this is the first time that I've done a totally realistic, yet not-so-realistic background. It was quite fun, really. xD Especially the trees. Also, this is the first time that I have painted water.\n\nAnyway, I hope you like this, and critique is welcome. 8D|Man!! I should go back to doing backgrounds. Idk how younger me was able to do it so well! Maybe because she was more focused on having fun rather than being scared that she'll mess up, which is how I usually think today lol |Charlie (Tentacool): "You there! Return that bag to Trainer Korin this instant!"\n\n??? (Aipom): You gotta go faster than that if you want this, chump!
Jack and Jill: Rollerskating|200707rollerskates.jpg|July 2007|TRUE||Jack and Jill (OCs) roller skating on colorful and checkered winding roads|This has got to be one of the most complicated pieces I've done yet. 8DDD I have no idea what caused me to do a piece like this, but I have to say, it was loads of fun. It was challenging, but it was fun. 8D\n\nEspecially since I used both the mouse and tablet in here. Tablet for the lineart and colors, mouse for everything else. xDD\n\nThis pic is a whopping 50 LAYERS. Now that is just a lot. And forgive me for the ugly watermark. If only art thieves would be extinct, then I would take it off. So sorry, guys. Forgive me. D:\n\nI don't know what kind of world Jack and Jill are in, but it sure is a silly one where you can rollerskate all the time. xD Of course, Jack is not used to all this fun, and Jill is enjoying it. xD\n\nHope you like this piece, guys. I sure do. 8D|I'm still so proud of this piece, especially since it was later tagged as a "Daily Deviation"! |
Wizard-in-Training|200704wizardmon.jpg|April 2007|||Wizardmon from Digimon casting a sparkling magic spell.|Being the little immature brat that I was, I have always denied the fact that I liked anime and have chosen to hate it alot. But then I realized that I can't hate the anime shows I used to watch as a kid. They were too good to be hated.\n\nOne of them was Digimon. Dang, that show was good,and I still have some old videos that my sis and I would record. ❤️ I have some episodes from all 4 seasons. Ha, good times.\n\nBut anyway, besides that, I just wanted to draw one of my favorite characters from the series, Wizardmon. And in case you didn't know, I needed to watch ALL of the episodes that he appeared in to be able to get references for his costume. xDD\n\nI hope that all of you enjoy this, just as much as I enjoyed drawing and coloring this.||
Contest: Smile for the Camera|200612smileforthecamera.jpg|December 2006|||Little Red Riding Hood (from Endling's Ever After) with the siblings Jack and Jill. Jill is smiling maniacally towards the camera. Jack is also smiling while also forcing Red to smile.|I don't know what to consider this: either a contest entry for or giftart for him. If this is not acceptable for him, then I'll consider this giftart. :D\n\nHere's some reasons why this is a contest entry. I've always wanted to participate in Endling's contests, but I was always afraid that they would not be good enough, but this time, I took a risk and made this. If this is acceptable as a contest entry then this will be in Category: F: Free-for-all.\n\nHere are some reasons why this is gift art. Dude. Endling is such a great guy to talk to, man. He must be one of the only popular artists who talks like a regular nice guy. Every conversation I have with him is like talking to a good friend, not an artist. He was what inspired me to be nice to everyone, no matter if you're popular or not. And he has such great art, too. He says that he's still improving. Dude, his art makes me explode from amazement right now, and if he says that he's still improving, then I don't know what will happen to me in the future. He's that awesome, man. You need to see his art right now. And since, he has been such a great guy to talk to I just wanted to make a pic for him to let him know how wonderful he is.\n\nNow, about this pic, this is basically a silly group picture with Endling's classic Fairy Tale character, Little Red, and my own characters, Jack and Jill. I've seen Little Red many times as a serious person in many pics. So why not make a colorful and silly group picture with other of the classic Fairy Tale characters? xD\n\nI'll give bios about Jack and Jill if you guys want me to.\n\nSorry for the long description, folks. |Jack and Jill started out as fan OCs of Endling's webcomic ["Ever After"](https://www.snafu-comics.com/ea/page-1)! That comic is so delightfully edgy, and I'm a little sad that it stopped updating, but I know the artist has moved on to better things! |
HAPPILY FROLICKING|200612bechnokidrun.jpg|December 2006|||Bechno Kid running on a grassy field while wielding a baseball bat with her name engraved on it.|Yes, I was in an extremely happy mood while doing this. I don't know why but I just wanted to draw BK running like the insane thief that she is.\n\nI don't have much to say, really. Except that I'm really happy right now since Christmas is so close now.|Another old piece of my persona!|
The Non-Limbed Hero|200611raymanattack.jpg|November 2006|||Rayman in a field wielding a gun with a plunger as its singular ammo. In the background are countless Rabbids obscured in shadow with only glowing red eyes showing|Oh god, I think it's been a year since I've drawn Rayman. I miss drawing him so much.\n\nI'm so excited for the new game, dudes. Can you tell?\n\nI've been doing some experimenting once again. This time, I've been doing a different coloring technique and I've been messing around with the light source, also. I'm actually proud of how this resulted in.\n\nI also have been drawing out new designs for guns and cannons. I still suck, but hey. If I keep working at it, I'm sure I'll get better.\n\nFEAR THE PLUNGER CANNON, DORKS.|I'm still incredibly salty about the direction this game took! I mean, the game was fun as a party game, but the concept art and screenshots showed that this game was going to be another adventure platformer. SIGHS.|
A Witch and a Genius|200608fawfulandcackletta.jpg|From August 2006|||Fawful and Cackletta from Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. They are posing menacingly in a cloudy and thundering background.|I have FURY!!!\n\nI enjoyed doing this, so I hope you enjoy.|I remember rendering the lines using only the Pen tool in Photoshop! I kinda wish Clip Studio Paint has the same feature, but maybe I'm missing something...|
Vivi|200604vivi.jpg|April 2006|||Vivi Ornitier as he appears in Kingdom Hearts II, sitting underneath a tree while looking at a pink butterfly that perched itself in his hand.|For those of you who have played Kingdom Hearts 2, I'm sure you know who this character is. If you didn't then, you should know him from Final Fantasy IX. If you don't know that game, then.....look him up on Wikipedia or something. xD\n\nFor those of you who don't know this guy, his name is Vivi. I drew him as he was in Kingdom Hearts 2. I began to love the little guy when I first saw him. He was so adorable, because of the way he looked, and the way how he sounded. It's funny how a lot of heartless look like Vivi. XD\n\nI started this pic a week ago, but couldn't finish it because of homework. Not only was I practicing how to draw Vivi, but I wanted to thank you all for the pageviews. It's almost 4,000 and I want to thank all of you guys for that.\n\nOverall, this pic was basically practice to see if I could do some nature for once. I've been messing around with Photoshop and got this. Isn't that funny? Enjoy the pic, while I suffer my head off trying to do the pixel art requests.||
The Weirdest Family of DOOM|200601familyofdoom.jpg|January 2006|||The Membrane family, with the text "Dib (Son)" above a pensive Dib, "Gaz (Daughter)" above Gaz playing a Game Boy Advance SP, and "Professor Membrane (Father)" above Professor Membrane observing a test tube with green liquid. The text at the bottom reads, "The Weirdest Family of Doom!!!"|Invader Zim is awesome. I've been obsessed since I've heard of it, but I couldn't watch it since I don't have cable. At my big sister's house, I saw and I got obsessed in it even more, and I love it. I decided to draw Dib's family in my possible style, and yes, Gaz has a red Game Boy SP.|I honestly only drew this family picture because I had a huge crush on Professor Membrane. I mean, I still have a crush on him even after all these years, but I digress! |
Terrible Trio|200512terribletrio.jpg|January 2006|||A spooky themed picture of Lock, Shock, and Barrel from Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas"|"'Tis Lock, Shock, & Barrel! I haven't been drawing them in a year, so I decided to draw and color the trio for the fun of it. I loved doing this." |Oooh!! Look at those blood splatter brushes! The pinnacle of edginess!|
Team Atom|200511teamatom.jpg|November 2005|||A group of teenagers named (from left to right): Patrick Proton, Nicole Neutron, and Elijah Electron||I remember my dad encouraging me to make more of my own OCs, so these three were drawn after a very inspirational science lesson! Their colors could use a bit of improvement...|
Invader Zim|200508zim.jpg|August 2005|||Invader Zim with a confused look against a very colorful background of magenta, green, and blue||This was drawn shortly after watching a few episodes of Invader Zim for the first time! I can't remember where I saw the episodes. I think it was on YouTube?|
Team Sonic (Human)|200506humanteamsonic.jpg|June 2005|||Team Sonic as humans.||Look at those outfits! Ouch!|
Jack Spicer & Wuya|200505jackspicer&wuya.jpg|May 2005|||Jack Spicer and Wuya from Xiaolin Showdown drawn and colored in colored pencils. They are looking menacingly at the camera.||I remember trying so hard to replicate Bleedman's art style. If you don't know who Bleedman is, consider yourself lucky!|
Dr. Octopus|200501DocOck.jpg|January 2005|||A younger-styled Doctor Octopus against a red and black background||Oh my gosh, this was around the time I got to watch Spider-Man 2 on DVD with my family, and I loved it so much! Alfred Molina's Doc Ock will remain as my favorite iteration of Doctor Octopus!|
Team...Botnik|20041219undecidedteam.jpg|December 2004|||Scratch, Grounder, and Coconuts from Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, but as humans, with Grounder biting on Scratch's tail, Scratch hanging on Grounder's antenna, and Coconuts readying to swing a spiky bat. The piece itself is in the style of Sonic Heroes, with Coconuts designated as 'Speed', Scratch as 'Flight', and Grounder as 'Power'.||Man, 12-year-old me had some really good ideas!|
Stella of the Fire Stars|20041022stella.jpg|October 2004|||an original character named 'Stella', displaying her fire powers.||I submitted this for an art contest at my middle school! I got second place, I think!|
A Dark Chao in the Making|20041017rayman&chao.jpg|October 2004|||Rayman and a Chao from the Sonic game franchise. Rayman has a pained expression on his face and is saying, 'Ow' as the Chao is biting on his hand.||I really feel like I was improving the Sonic Adventure style with this piece! I also found how to make a screen-like background using the Halftone filter in Photoshop! Good memories!|
Your Angle or Debil|20040912choice.jpg|September 2004|||Bechno Kid drawn in a style similar to "Fairly OddParents" trying to decide from her two sides/fairies. One has bat-shaped wings and a wand with a skull at the tip, while the other has angel wings with a wand that has a heart at its tip. Bechno's text reads,  'Rats! Either hero or dark. I have to choose...Maybe hero...or dark...||One of my many attempts at replicating the Fairly Oddparents style! It was actually what got me into making a hobby out of replicating styles. We also get a first glimpse at my persona!|
Sonikku!!|20040412shadowandamy.jpg|April 2004|||Amy Rose hugging Shadow the Hedgehog and mistaking him for Sonic. Her text reads, 'Oh Sonic, I missed you so much!!' while Shadow's reads, 'ACK!'||I actually really like how I colored this piece. A little rough around the edges, but still really smooth! I should get back into using colored pencils again once of these days.|
Stained Glass Angel|20040310mariaangel.jpg|March 2004|||Maria Robotnik with white wings on her back. The background has a stained-glass effect over a red, orange, yellow, and green gradient with several two afterimages of her.||I would see a lot of random angel anime girls, and of course I had to draw Maria as one!|
Happy New Year 2004|happynewyear.jpg|January 2004|||Human versions of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, Rouge, and Shadow celebrating New Year's for 2004||I actually have a different version of this with a "cool" background, but I like how this one looks.|

In the background is a purple and blue photograph with two moons visible.||One of my oldest Sonic OCs! She's not THE oldest, but definitely one of them! She was heavily inspired by the character of the same name from Jackie Chan Adventures|
HERO & DARK|sonicandshadow.jpg|Fall 2003|||Sonic and Shadow with text above them saying "Hero & Dark" and a blue, black, and white gradient.||I want to play this game again, especially for the Chao Garden!|
Cat Got Your Tongue?|sonictailscat.jpg|Fall 2003|||Sonic, Tails, and a cat biting on Tails's tongue.||Ripped this joke from a Sunday comic that I thought would be hilarious to redraw with Sonic characters.|
Another Emerald Thief|KnucklesandShadow.jpg|Summer 2003|||Shadow running away from an angry Knuckles as the former is holding the Master Emerald.||Rouge is taking a sick day, so Shadow's filling in for her.|
A Real Nightmare|amynightmare.png|Summer 2003|||A large mob of Amy clones chasing after Sonic and Shadow. In the backgorund is a large apparition of Amy saying, "You'll never stop me from lovin' you." Shadow's thought reads, "Why does this girl have to like this faker?" while Sonic is scared while yelling, "This has to be a nightmare!!!!"||Why is Shadow in this nightmare with Sonic? Uh...emotional support?|
