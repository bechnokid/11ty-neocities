Reference: Lady Siduri||TRUE|20250908boco_siduri_ref.jpg|Reference for Siduri, an OC for "Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, the Girl, and the Five Heroes|2025-09-08||Here's a reference for Siduri to go along with Gilgamesh's reference! She's a formidable knight of the "Black Wolves", one of two armies of the Barnard Kingdom led by Captain Volg. Siduri comes off as a bit dim-witted, but can be frighteningly perceptive at times. Her life was turned upside down after the assassination of the king.\n\nCaptain Gilgamesh of the second army, "Hell's Gate", not only manipulated Volg's second-in-command, Enkidu, into assassinating the king and then framing Volg, but he later kidnapped the princess and attempted to force her into marrying him. Volg would team up with a mysterious chocobo who had wandered into the kingdom and together they would defeat Gilgamesh, foiling his plans.\n\nGilgamesh, having been stripped of his role as captain, was to be tried for his crimes, with Lady Siduri being tasked to escort him to the court. That is...until the two were spirited away by a Zu, no doubt attracted to Siduri's shimmmering armor (but it was actually Gilgamesh's brightly-colored robes that drew in the fiend).\n\nAlthough Siduri managed to free herself and Gilgamesh from the clutches of the winged beast, they were taken far, FAR away from the kingdom, and that's where the story of their own adventure to return to the Kingdom's capital begins.||**Text near a chibi Siduri at the bottom left**: Actual battle armor\n\n**Text near Siduri starting from the left**: Basic armor worn in castle. Mostly used for show.\n\n**Text near Siduri from the second left**: Basic dagger for defense\n\n**Text near Siduri in the far right**: Civilian outfit\n\n**Text near her arm on the far right**: Has a couple of scars, including a bite"
Reference: Ex-Captain Gilgamesh||TRUE|20250908boco_gilgamesh_ref.jpg|Reference for Gilgamesh from "Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, the Girl, and the Five Heroes"|2025-09-08||Do you ever just want to play a game that was only released in Japan and also doesn't have a translation ROM, so you buy the game and then play it with your wife despite not knowing any Japanese so the two of you play through it by manually translating every dialogue by taking pictures and putting it through Google Translate, or are you normal?\n\nAnyway, here's Gilgamesh, because there's no high quality art of his final form, and I'm taking some artistic liberties so I don't go insane trying to figure out his design!||**Text near Gilgamesh's top headshot on the left**: Facial markings are natural. The rest are tattooes.\n\n**Text near Gilgamesh's bottom headshot on left**: Grade A charmer and manipulator\n\n**Text near Gilgamesh's hand and foot**: Additional tattoos\n\n**Text near Gilgamesh on right side of image**: Usually hides (all) arms when wearing robe"
