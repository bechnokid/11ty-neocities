Old Everwyrm|||202010sharaishvalda.jpg|A reference of a gijinka of Shara Ishvalda from "Monster Hunter: World".|October 2020||A gijinka for Monster Hunter! I haven't gotten around to making gijinkas of any other monsters save for a few that I scribbled here and there, so Shara is the only one I made a "proper" reference for. She's a creepy grandma dragon who no one likes to visit, and she's perfectly ok with that!|Text near her head: "Head twitches sometimes. Likes rocks...as a snack"\n\nText near her hand: "Cool, but not practical in opening soda cans. :("\n\nText near her coat tails: "Always moving somehow"
Time for a Kiss?|TRUE||202009chokeonapocketwatch.jpg|Drs. Neo Cortex and Nefarious Tropy from the "Crash Bandicoot" game series.

Give It To Me Straight, Doc|||202008giveittomestraight.jpg|Dr. Neo Cortex from the "Crash Bandicoot" game series looking smugly at the camera with a cup of tea in one hand. The text bubble above him reads, "Me, straight? That's a good one."|August 2020||One of my favorite pieces from 2020! This was essentially a response to homophobic gamers who were harassing someone for making a very convincing screenshot edit of N. Tropy and Cortex kissing. I don't know if I can find it again...|
An Actually Normal Family...of Doom!|||202007vitaminfamily.jpg|Two fan characters from Invader Zim. Dr. Vitamin is on the left while her daughter Amelia is on the right.|July 2020|I've had fan OCs become their own characters, but never the other way around..until now! These two have been collecting dust, so I thought about putting them in a fandom until I figure something out for them!\n\nWhich fandom, you ask? lmao I'm too embarrassed to say, but the doctor's tag might give you a bit of a clue :'3 |\-whispers\- It's Invader Zim. :3c|

Claremont (right) belongs to Sam!||
The "Most Unlikely Couple" Award Goes To...|||201910twolosers.jpg|Ganondorf and Linebeck from the "Legend of Zelda" game series in an embrace, with Ganondorf hugging Linebeck with his cape.|October 2019||H-hear me out!! This started out as a "What if" scenario since the two both make appearances in "Super Smash Bros Ultimate". Ok, Linebeck is more of a static image NPC but still. I just thought it'd be funny to push two treasure-hunters together and see what happens, and now they're my favorite LoZ crackship lmao. |

The coloring was mostly experimental here, but I'm so glad at how it came out! Enjoy!|The piece I did for an Akusai (Axel x Saix) zine! I was sadly unable to render a background like I wanted since this piece was made shortly after getting my full-time job. This is also the final piece I ever made for a zine! Participating in zines was a lot of fun, but way too time-consuming and stressful for me. Perhaps another time! |

His coat and tie are tattered.|June 2019|Based on this [Tumblr ask](https://64.media.tumblr.com/32b4a821e16afaa3a6297a8d92c90f7c/tumblr_inline_prj8ukSLC11qze3co_500.png)! This was so much fun to work on! I've been meaning to redesign Waldo's kiddos as well as redraw some of [those silly poses](https://bechnokid.tumblr.com/post/184575079131).

The background is a purple-pink night sky with some clouds, starts, and the crescent moon.|October 2018|I found a new SAI brush to test out, and I also wanted to work with lighter colors!

In the back are Spewart menacingly chewing on a carrot and Rango standing tall and crossing his arms|June 2018|Super Mario Odyssey is such a good game aaaaaaa.

I hadn't colored like this in a while, so I was happy to know that I haven't lost my touch, yet!\n\nI've always imagined Colress to be much taller than Faba and I'm glad that these heights are actually canon!

Coloress Science|TRUE||201702dumbesthairinexistence.jpg|Colress as he appears in Pokemon Sun and Moon|February 2017|Despite having played BW2, I was never interested in Colress until I encountered him in the Battle Tree!

He Got the Moves||TRUE|201701hegotthemoves.jpg|Guzma and Plumeria from Pokemon Sun and Moon dancing|January 2017|Is it considered egotistical to be inspired by a [MMD video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tZGxmkAKOU) you made? Aw heck, I don't care, I had fun drawing this!||
