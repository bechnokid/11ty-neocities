Unlikely Pen Pals|||202408otonodebiruko.jpg|Otonoten and Devilkotchi from the Tamagtochi Angel and Tamagotchi Devil devices but with human-like designs. The text above them reads "Pen pals!" with two arrows pointing at the characters, and images of them from the Tap and Hatch mobile game also appear next to them.||August 2024|I read up on some lore on the vintage Tamagotchi devices, and I was inspired to draw these two!||
Fionna and Cake|||202310fionnaandcake.jpg|Fionna Campbell, Cake the Cat, and Simon Petrikov in poses inspired by Pop Team Epic. Fionna is leaning to the right side of the picture with a smile on her face, while Simon is leaning to the left side with a slightly concerned smile. Cake is in the middle, making two obscene gestures with her hands.||October 2023|Drew this to celebrate Fionna and Cake's fantastic finale! I loved the trio's dynamic throughout the whole show!||
Happy Birthday, Stephen Strange (2022)||TRUE|202211strangebday.jpg|America Chavez, Sorcerer Supreme Wong, and a human Cloak of Levitation singing and clapping to celebrate Doctor Stephen Strange's birthday. Stephen is sitting on a chair, humored by the slightly wonky cake in front of him.||November 2022|I'm not sure how it was established that November 18th would be Stephen's birthday, but I'm not complaining! <3||
A Dance Once Upon a Time|||202210dance.jpg|Doctor Strange and the Cloak of Levitation dancing together, inspired by the iconic scene from Disney's Sleeping Beauty||October 2022|Sam and I had an idea that Cloak would watch Sleeping Beauty and would get inspired by that scene with Aurora dancing with her animal friends. He then manages to convince Stephen to dance with him. :3||
Pining|||202210cloakstrange.jpg|Doctor Strange with his hands being held by the Cloak of Levitation (human form). Cloak is looking at Stephen almost with a look of longing, while Stephen is slightly taken aback.||October 2022|"""We're all trying to figure out how to change you back, but...we never thought to ask whether or not you even want to.""\n\nA scene from an unfinished fanfic that Sam and I were working on! It was about how the Cloak of Levitation was suddenly turned into a human by a witch's spell and the story would be of how Stephen and Cloak grow even closer than they ever thought possible."||
Family Photo|||202209masterofblinking.jpg|America Chavez, Sorcerer Surpeme Wong, and Doctor Stephen Strange taking a family picture together. America and Wong are smiling and making "peace signs" with their hands, while Stephen accidentally blinks||September 2022|In one of [Linkara's older videos of Doctor Strange](https://youtu.be/XHAy19jTomo), he jokingly points out that Stephen is not only the Master of the Mystic Arts, but also the Master of "Blinking in Photographs". I laughed so hard at that joke that I had to draw it out for MCU Stephen! xDD||
