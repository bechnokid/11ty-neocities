This was originally going to be on the splash page, but oops, I made it way too detailed!\n\nHere are some details about the hunting group here:\n<ul><li><strong>Connie: </strong>Heavy Bowgun user. Currently wearing the Rompololo armor while in the Forbidden Lands. Born and raised in a rider village, but took a different career path in hunting later down the line.</li><li><strong>Socks: </strong>Melynx Palico. Very strict about abiding to safety regulations and always has Connie chug an Armordrug before setting out on a hunt.</li><li><strong>Gilgamesh: </strong>Seikret steed for Connie. Huge troublemaker, no one knows if Connie controls him or if it's the other way around.</li></ul>||
