Hi, I'm **Bechno Kid** (she/her), the head honcho of this hideout.

You can call me **"Bechno"** or even just **"Bec"**. You can call me "Kid", but I don't recommend it unless you're older than me!

I'm a full-time software developer born in the early '90s who enjoys drawing on the side and tends to yap for hours about her interests. I like coffee, tea, and almost any caffeinated drink out there except for carbonated energy drinks.

I may code as a career, but I am no means an expert at all. I frequently look up StackOverflow when I need help with my code, even at work. Regardless, I do enjoy learning new things every day!

I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and somehow managed to land in the top 20% of my graduating class. People will say that I am a hard-working student, but all I can remember from my college days was utter confusion. I'm not even sure how I even landed my current job, but at least I'm making money doing what I love!
