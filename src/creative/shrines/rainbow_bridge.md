# The Rainbow Bridge

I was never a pet person, so I never knew about the concept of the "Rainbow Bridge" until my late 20's. After the passing of Ava (who will be mentioned below), I sought to create this shrine to help remember whichever small friend I had formed a close bond with in the hopes of dealing with grief.

## Ava "Avalypuff"

Ava, also known as Avalypuff, was a Border-Collie mix, the first dog that my wife Sam called hers and, technically, one of the two dogs I've owned in my life. I came into Ava's life in 2018 when I moved in with Sam and Dan. I never dogs and was often scared of them, but I **loved** that rascal. She was an old dog, but she still welcomed me into the family with her frequent smiles (that were usually followed by adorable sneezes).

She collapsed on the floor on October 26th from a ruptured tumor. I wasn't able to be there with her due to me being 45 minutes away at work with no way to get home since Sam drove me that morning. The last thing I got to say to her was during a phone call that she was a good dog and that I loved her.

I wish I could've been there for you, Ava. I wish I could've given you the pets that you deserved while at the hospital. You weren't even my dog, but you made me feel so welcome that I can't help but also see you as my dog. I'll miss you, you old rascal, and I hope you're celebrating up in heaven. When the time comes, I hope I'll see you there.

I love you, Ava.
