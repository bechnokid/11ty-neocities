### General

- Due to some...things going on at my work that are out of my control, I am temporarily working from home! I've been enjoying it so far, but I don't want to get too used to this lifestyle! {% emote 'embarrassed' %} I need to make sure I get enough sun and that I am diligent in any sort of workout routine!
- I learned how to make the perfect hard-boiled eggs, thanks to Sam! They're so good!! With how expensive eggs have become, they've become a nice treat to have every now and then.

### Playing

- [Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/)
  - Participating in the Flamefete Festival has been so fun!! Sam and I are still looking for miniature crowns for Rey Dau and Gore Magala, as well as both large and mini crowns for Lagiacrus! They've been really difficult to find despite it being exponentially easier to find crowns in this game!
